The BMPCs are the cells from which the different types of blood and other cells grow.~In patients with heart failure, the heart muscle does not pump well. Over a period of years, this continues to get worse until the patient dies of heart failure. The investigators are trying to find out if the injection of these BMPCs can make a change in the functioning of these areas of the heart muscle. Data from studies around the world have suggested that when patients with heart failure receive these cells by direct injection into their hearts they show signs of recovered heart function, however, there has been no evidence from actual studies of the cells of the patient's hearts to show how this process works. It is the investigator's plan to inject an eligible participant's heart with cells that are from one's own bone marrow during an operation to receive a ventricular assist device (VAD) or partial artificial heart and then to study the function of the heart while awaiting a heart transplant. The investigators will then examine the heart after it has been removed as part of the regular heart transplant operation for any microscopic changes (changes too small to be seen by the unaided eye but large enough to be studied under a microscope) at the site where the cells are injected. Participants will have no change in the chances of receiving a heart transplant by agreeing to participate in this study. There will also be no delay in receiving a VAD operation while waiting to participate in this study. This Phase I study has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enroll and treat patients. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Investigational New Drug number (IND BB #) is 12304.

With bronchiolitis and influenza, she participated widely in weight of winter epidemics that causes problems every year our health care system, particularly in the pediatric emergency and inpatient since they are the second leading cause of hospitalization in children. The main symptoms of viral acute gastroenteritis are diarrhea and vomiting which exposes children to the risk of sometimes severe dehydration, the most common cause of hospitalization. There is no specific treatment for these infections. At most, there is a vaccine against severe rotavirus diarrhea (Rotarix \u00ae and RotaTeq \u00ae), but does not yet official recommendations to use in France. The treatment of acute gastroenteritis virus is symptomatic and is generally based on the use of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) whose administration is limited by the frequent presence of vomiting. Until now, no treatment has demonstrated its effectiveness on vomiting due to acute gastroenteritis virus in children. Conventional anti-emetics, widely prescribed, are ineffective in practice, very few studies in this indication and encumbered side effects. Several drugs have long been used in children to fight against severe vomiting associated with the administration of anti-cancer chemotherapy, such as granisetron (Kytril \u00ae) and ondansetron (Zofren \u00ae). The mechanism of action of these molecules is well known. They act both on the enteric nervous system by blocking serotonin receptors. Several placebo-controlled trials suggest that ondansetron is effective in reducing the number of vomiting in children emergency consultant for acute gastroenteritis. However, the method used in these tests and the number of children enrolled has not yet demonstrated the efficacy of ondansetron on the number of admissions, the number of emergency and return the cost / benefit ratio of this treatment. In addition, several studies reported the occurrence of watery stools more frequently in children treated with the placebo group.~Evidence that ondansetron is well tolerated and effective for reducing the severity of vomiting during acute gastroenteritis pediatrics winter could support the use of this treatment in routine pediatric emergencies.~This study is a clinical trial, multicenter, controlled versus placebo whose main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron to decrease the intensity of vomiting in children with acute gastroenteritis during winter emergencies Upon arrival to the emergency room after signing. Consent, an ECG is performed in eligible patients. Children meet all the criteria for inclusion and non-inclusion receive, at random, one of two treatments: ondansetron (active) or placebo. The study does not alter the usual care of the child to the emergency room. After passing emergency, patients will be followed in the study for 8 days, through a phone call home to J3 and J7.

RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving RO4929097 together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:~* Histologically confirmed malignant glioma (phase I)~  * Glioblastoma~ * Anaplastic astrocytoma~ * Anaplastic oligodendroglioma~ * Mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytoma~* Histologically confirmed glioblastoma following radiotherapy and temozolomide (phase II)~* Progressive or recurrent disease after conformal external-beam radiation therapy and concurrent temozolomide, followed by \u2265 1 adjuvant course of temozolomide~* Measurable disease by MRI within the past 2 weeks~* Tumor tissue form indicating availability of archived tissue from initial resection at diagnosis of malignant glioma completed and signed by a pathologist~* Karnofsky performance status 60-100%~* ANC \u2265 1,500/mm\u00b3~* Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm\u00b3~* Hemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dL~* Total bilirubin normal~* AST and ALT \u2264 2.5 times upper limit of normal~* Creatinine normal OR creatinine clearance \u2265 60 mL/min~  * Urine protein: If proteinuria \u2265 +2 protein, a protein level should be \\< 1,000 mg by a 24-hour urine collection~* Electrolytes (calcium, chloride, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, sodium) within institutional normal limits~* Fertile patients must use 2 forms of effective contraception before, during, and for \u2265 12 months (6 months phase II, bevacizumab arm only) after treatment~* Negative pregnancy test~* Not pregnant or nursing~* At least 5 years since prior malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, or bladder~* Mini Mental State Exam score of \u2265 15~* Must be able to tolerate MRI~Exclusion Criteria:~* No serious concurrent infection or medical illness that would jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the treatment outline in this protocol with reasonable safety~* No history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 or bevacizumab~* Must be able to swallow capsules~* No malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with intestinal absorption~* No baseline QTcF \\> 450 msec (male) or QTcF \\> 470 msec (female)~* Not history of being serologically positive for hepatitis A, B, or C~* No history of cirrhosis~* No uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, or hypokalemia despite adequate electrolyte supplementation~* No uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, any of the following:~  * Ongoing or active infection~ * Symptomatic congestive heart failure~ * Unstable angina pectoris~ * A history of torsades de pointes or other significant cardiac arrhythmias other than chronic, stable atrial fibrillation~ * Psychiatric illness and/or social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements~* No serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture~* No history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within the past 6 months~* No significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm requiring surgical repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within the past 6 months~* No clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including any of the following:~  * Inadequately controlled hypertension (systolic BP \\> 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP \\> 90 mm Hg) despite antihypertensive medication~ * History of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack at any time~ * Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the past 12 months~ * NYHA grade II-IV congestive heart failure~ * Serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia~ * Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm or history of aortic dissection)~ * Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease~* No evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy~* No known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human antibodies~* No requirement for antiarrhythmics or other medications known to prolong QTc~* One or 2 prior treatment regimens allowed~* Recovered from severe toxicity of prior therapy~* At least 3 months since prior radiotherapy~* At least 6 weeks since prior nitrosourea~* At least 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy~* At least 4 weeks since prior and no other concurrent investigational agents~* At least 2 weeks since prior non-cytotoxic, FDA-approved agent (e.g., Tarceva \\[erlotinib hydrochloride\\], hydroxychloroquine, bevacizumab, etc.)~* At least 28 days since any prior surgery~* No prior \u03b3-secretase inhibitors and/or bevacizumab~* At least 10 days since prior and no concurrent enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug~* No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients",

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAs) have been shown to be at least as effective and safe as SOC in VTE treatment. But in the clinical trials, moderate renally impaired patients were poorly represented and patients with severe renal insufficiency not at all. So no dose reduction was considered.~Surprisingly, DOAs have been approved for VTE treatment in moderate and severe renally impaired patients. There is need to evaluate a reduced dose of DOAs for VTE treatment in patients with moderate and severe renal insufficiency.~We plan to evaluate reduced doses of 2 DOAs (apixaban, rivaroxaban) compared to SOC in VTE patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency in terms of net clinical benefit (recurrent VTE and major bleeding) at 3 months.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:~* Patients with a moderate renal insufficiency defined by a creatinine clearance between 30 to 50 ml/min (Cockcroft and Gault formulae) or a severe renal insufficiency (between 15 to 29 ml/min)~* Patients with acute objectively confirmed symptomatic proximal deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) (with or without deep-vein thrombosis), planned to be treated for at least 3 months~* Patients \\>18 years~* Life expectancy more than 3 months~* Social security affiliation~* Signed informed consent~Exclusion Criteria:~* Indication for anticoagulants other than VTE~* Active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding contraindicating anticoagulant treatment; a systolic blood pressure of more than 180 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of more than 110 mm Hg~* Anticoagulation for more than 72 hours prior to randomization~* Chronic liver disease or chronic hepatitis~* Patient at high risk of bleeding~* Creatinine clearance \\<15 ml/min or end stage renal disease or indication for extra-renal dialysis~* Need for concomitant anti-platelet therapy other than aspirin 75-325 mg per day.

Increased doses can lead to over sedation and consequently lead to difficulty with breathing. The ON-Q pain relief systems uses a local anesthetic under the skin. The anesthetic is called bupivicaine, and it is delivered from a thin tube approximately 10 inches long is tunneled under the skin along the back and parallel to the spine. The medication is stored in an elastic pump which delivers a slow continuous drip of medication from multiple holes in the tubing. Subjects will be randomized to either standard intravenous opioid pain management or the ON-Q pain relief device with supplemental opioid medication if needed. The device will remain in use until the subjects are able to breathe without the ventilator.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:~* \\> 18 years of age~* 3 or more rib fractures~* Intubated ready for weaning from ventilator support~* FI02 \\< 50%~* Peep \\< 10cm H2O~Exclusion Criteria:~* \\< 18 years of age~* Pregnant~* Unable to communicate pain status~* Allergy to local anesthetics~* Coagulopathy~* Skin lesions or abnormalities from previous injury or surgery~* \\< 3 rib fractures",

The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) the FDA-approved drugs etoposide and trastuzumab have on this type of breast cancer and to determine if these drugs are safe to use together. This research is being done to find more effective treatment for this type of condition.~In this study, trastuzumab and etoposide will be given by intravenous infusion (IV; through a vein) on the first 3 days of every 3-week cycle. This is repeated for 6 cycles. After 6 cycles, only trastuzumab will be given until worsening of disease. In this study, a small amount of your tissue that was collected when you had surgery will be evaluated in the lab to look at genetic differences among people and how those differences may affect a response to a specific drug or medicine. This testing will look for a gene called Top2A.

The deficits of children with ASD range across social communication and academic skills. One of the effective interventions that have been used commonly for ASD is the model-lead-test, which includes modeling, prompting children to practice target skills together, and providing children with affirmative feedback or error correction. Previous research has demonstrated that the model-lead-test is successful in teaching different skills for individuals with ASD, including functional, social, and academic skills. The vast majority of the studies had researchers, therapists, or teachers implement the intervention. However, there is clear empirical support and implications for interventions mediated by more familiar persons, such as parents and siblings, which may lead to better effects, maintenance, and generalization due to more practice opportunities in the natural environments. Research has supported the effectiveness of using parents or peers as agents to deliver interventions for individuals with ASD, whereas fewer studies explored the use of siblings to deliver or mediate intervention. As typically developing siblings are an essential part of the daily life of children with ASD, it makes logical extensions to have siblings as mediators to deliver interventions.~In the initial findings, the investigators found the typically developing siblings can accurately implement the model-lead-test procedure that improved various skills of their siblings with ASD. This project will extend these findings by examining the efficacy of the sibling-implemented intervention on early literacy (reading) and social reciprocity (conversation and play) of children with ASD as well as the sibling relationship before, during, and after the intervention.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:~* Both siblings can demonstrate compliance during instruction.~* Children with ASD can imitate physical actions and repeat vocalizations, answering common questions, label common objects and actions with adjectives.~* Typically developing children can sound out and blend letters during reading.~Exclusion Criteria:~* Children with aggression towards their siblings and noncompliance during instruction~* Children with ASD who can sound out and blend letters.",

Subjects should have completed 4-6 cycles of induction therapy with carboplatin + pemetrexed or cisplatin + pemetrexed and have had Stable Disease (SD), Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) as the best response to be enrolled into the study. The primary objective is to estimate the hazard ratio of progression free survival (PFS) in advanced NSCLC subjects given maintenance therapy of pazopanib (Arm A) relative to pemetrexed (Arm B). The secondary objectives are: overall survival, response rates, safety and tolerability. A total of approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Safety and efficacy assessments will be regularly performed on all subjects.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:~* Signed written Informed Consent.~* Subjects must complete 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin + pemetrexed or cisplatin + pemetrexed and have had SD, PR or CR at the time of screening/enrolment as the best response.~* Prior surgery and/or localized irradiation for NSCLC is permitted as long as it was a minimum of 4 weeks before entering the study.

The study will be conducted in two parts.~Part 1 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ruxolitinib when given as described to patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. A goal of Part 1 will be to identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib when given with gemcitabine with or without nab-paclitaxel. This dose will be selected for use in Part 2 of the study.~Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary clinical activity of ruxolitinib at the dose defined in Part 1 used in combination with gemcitabine with or without nab-paclitaxel in subjects with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.~After multiple challenges of trial conduct, by mutual agreement between investigators and sponsor, dose escalation ended after Cohort B1, RUX 10 mg twice daily (BID) - GCSF in October 2014. Therefore, the MTD was not reached. No safety issues led to the decision to stop further enrollment.~Because of the early study termination, samples for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and computed tomography for tumor burden were collected, but not analyzed; analysis data are not available. The data cutoff for this posting is 22 SEP 2015. As of the data cutoff, 1 subject was receiving treatment in the study and had been enrolled for 47 weeks.

Patients with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) can be included when treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor is indicated according to national guidelines. Included patients will receive stereotactic radiotherapy to one or two tumour lesion(s) in addition to the PD-1 inhibitor, and toxicity is the primary endpoint.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:~5.1.1 Subject Inclusion Criteria~* Age \\>18 years~* Advanced NSCLC~* Adequate newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a recurrent tumor lesion~* Adequate is defined as a biopsy with at least 5 sections tumour tissue available.~* Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria~* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1~* Life expectancy \\> 3 months~* A tumour lesion suitable for radiotherapy treatment~* Adequate organ function based on clinical examination and lab values (Hb \\>9.0, Leucocytes \\> 2.0, Trc \\> 100, AST/ALT \\<3 ULN)~* Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding~* WOCBP should use an adequate highly effective method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks~* For the purpose of this document, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.~  * Highly effective contraception methods includes methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include:~ * combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)~ * progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable)~ * intrauterine device (IUD)~ * intrauterine hormone-releasing system ( IUS)~ * bilateral tubal occlusion~ * vasectomised partner~* sexual abstinence \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_~* Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for a period of 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives~* Previously untreated or treated NSCLC pts, where treatment with PD1-inhibitor in indicated according to national guidelines.~Exclusion Criteria:~5.1.2 Subject Exclusion Criteria~* Disease suitable for curative salvage surgery~* Treatment with any investigational medicinal product (IMP) that may interfere with the study treatment, within 2 weeks prior to first administration of study drug.~* Significant cardiac, pulmonary or other medical illness that would limit activity or survival~* Pregnancy or lactation.~* Patients with EGFR-mutation or ALK-translocation not treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor previously~* Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the investigational product~* Patients who test positive for hepatitis B, C or HIV.~* Known active brain metastases. Patients with stable / treated brain metastases can be included.~* Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or medical condition requiring high doses (\\>30 mg prednisolone daily) of systemic steroids or other forms of immunosuppressive therapy~* Any reason why, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient should not participate",
