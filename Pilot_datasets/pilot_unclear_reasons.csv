NCT00800007,Study of Safety and Tolerability of Multiple Intravenous Doses of ANZ-521 in Adults With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus,,Unknown,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and antiviral effects of multiple intravenous doses of ANZ-521 in patients with chronic Hepatitis C virus.","This Phase 1/2 Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Double-Blind clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of ANZ-521, an investigational product that is a weakened form (attenuated) of Listeria monocytogenes, a type of bacteria that is commonly found in the environment. ANZ-521 has been altered in the lab to reduce its ability to cause disease, while maintaining stimulation of the immune system. ANZ-521 has also been genetically modified with recombinant DNA to encode consensus sequence antigens called NS5B polymerase and NS3 proteinase that correspond to viral proteins found on the virus causing Hepatitis C. It is hoped that ANZ-521 will stimulate an immune response to the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the liver, thereby demonstrating an effective therapy for individuals with chronic HCV infection.~The purpose of this first clinical trial with ANZ-521 is to identify an appropriate dose of the investigational agent for later clinical studies and to explore safety when given to consenting adults with HCV. Immunological response to ANZ-521 in study participants will also be measured. Patients who choose to enter the study must meet all study entry criteria. The first part of the study (Part A) will enroll subjects who have received prior treatment with standard of care therapy for HCV. The second part of the study (Part B) will enroll subjects who have not previously received standard of care therapy for HCV or were intolerant to standard of care.

NCT00790478,Melatonin and Ulcerative Colitis: A Pilot Clinical Trial,,Unknown,"Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease that afflicts up to one million people in the U.S. Symptoms include rectal urgency, bloody diarrhea, moderate to severe abdominal pain, fever, and fatigue. Melatonin is a hormone that is associated with sleep and other body functions that may be related to health. Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland and, in fact, it is produced in even greater amounts in the gut. Melatonin appears to be important in gastrointestinal tract physiology and health, and data from cell and animal experiments, and some studies in humans, suggest that supplemental melatonin may help ameliorate colitis. Given that current treatments for ulcerative colitis are not always effective, and often have serious side effects, there is considerable interest in finding alternative treatments for this disease. However, experimental data on the ability of melatonin to improve ulcerative colitis in humans are lacking. To address this, we plan to conduct a pilot clinical trial (60 adult male and female participants) that will obtain preliminary data about the effectiveness of melatonin supplementation as a treatment for ulcerative colitis in adult men and women with the disease.~The Melatonin and Ulcerative Colitis study funded by a grant from the Broad Foundation's Broad Medical Research Program (http://www.broadmedical.org).","Problem of Interest:~Current treatments for ulcerative colitis are not always effective, and often have serious side effects. Therefore, there is considerable interest in finding alternative treatments for this disease. Physiologic data suggest that melatonin is important in gastrointestinal (GI) tract physiology and health, and data from in vitro studies, animal experiments, and some studies in humans suggest that supplemental melatonin may have an ameliorative effect on colitis. However, experimental data on the ability of melatonin to improve ulcerative colitis in humans are lacking. The long-term goal of this proposal is to examine whether melatonin supplementation helps alleviate mild-to-moderate colitis symptoms. To this end, we plan to conduct a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (n = 60) that will obtain preliminary data about the effectiveness of melatonin supplementation as a treatment for ulcerative colitis in adult men and women with mild to moderate flare-up of the disease. The specific aims of the trial are: (i) to estimate the effect of 12 weeks of 5 mg/day supplementation with melatonin on ulcerative colitis remission, (ii) to estimate the effects of melatonin supplementation on tissue levels of cytokines and other markers of inflammation, (iii) to determine whether melatonin's effects vary according to baseline (endogenous) melatonin levels, (iv) to determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of ulcerative colitis patients for a larger, more definitive study, and (v) to determine whether melatonin supplementation has any adverse side-effects when taken daily for 12 weeks in adults with ulcerative colitis.~How the Problem Will Be Studied:~The overall study design of this trial is that of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients will be recruited from those seeing their IBD clinicians at one of three study sites: Emory University, Atlanta Gastroenterology Associates, or the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Eligibility will be based first on the severity of disease, determined by physician exam, and through sigmoidoscopy (as part of the Mayo Scoring System). The Project Coordinator will meet with patients to further determine eligibility, as there are restrictions based on age, medical history, medications taken, pregnancy, and others. Willing patients who are otherwise eligible at that point will undergo a one-week placebo run-in to assess compliance and any reported side-effects. Eligible patients will undergo their first study sigmoidoscopy, will provide biological samples for processing (blood, urine, and rectal biopsy tissue), and will be randomized into treatment (5 mg/d at bedtime) or placebo (also at bedtime). They will be given sleep logs and symptoms logs to fill out weekly during the trial, and they will fill out a colitis-related quality of life questionnaire. They will be called once per week by the Project Coordinator to check on the study participants, to assess compliance and side-effects, and to answer any questions. There will be a clinical visit two weeks after randomization, to assess symptoms and any side effects. The next scheduled clinical visit is at the end of the trial, where another sigmoidoscopy and sample collection will take place. Any other interim clinical visit will be at the discretion of the patients and his or her study physician. Lastly, patients will complete a questionnaire about colitis-related quality of life during the trial and will be asked as to whether they suspected which treatment arm they were in. The following period will be devoted to data analysis, publication of study results, and closeout. Please see attached protocol for details.~Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained:~The proposed research will have both public health and scientific importance. Ulcerative colitis is not a rare condition, and sufferers often deal with debilitating symptoms. Thus, a greater understanding of ways of treat ulcerative colitis would be of potential relevance to a great number of people.~How the Research Will Advance Scientific Knowledge and/or Human Health~UC is a common gastrointestinal disorder in adults, one that can have debilitating symptoms and severe health consequences. Current treatments are not always effective, and often have serious side effects. Therefore, there is considerable interest in finding alternative treatments for this disease. Physiologic data suggest that melatonin is important in GI tract physiology and health, and data from in vitro studies, animal experiments, and some studies in humans, suggest that supplemental melatonin may have an ameliorative effect on colitis. Given our newly-funded pilot clinical trial was awarded the maximum funding available from the Broad Foundation, with no funds allocated to explore potentially important biological mechanisms, we feel that this is an excellent opportunity to validate potential clinical benefits of melatonin as an adjunctive therapy for UC in humans, with mechanistic insights into the various levels of the inflammatory process that may be influenced by melatonin in vivo. Thus, the proposed study is a) innovative, b) supported by experimental data, and c) may ultimately lead to improved treatment of UC based on clinical and mechanistic knowledge gained through this study conducted in human patients.~To date, there has been no formal clinical trial of melatonin therapy for UC in humans, and there have been few mechanistic investigations into the potential mode of action of this compound on the pathomechanisms identified thus far. Given the very low toxicity documented for even high levels of melatonin in animals and human subjects, this relatively inexpensive treatment may represent an attractive alternative for patient suffering from mild to mid-grade UC given the low incidence of side effects.",PHASE2,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology disorder,MeSH

The AML cells will also be positive for c-kit (a stem cell factor receptor), which is involved in cancer cell growth. Nilotinib is a drug that blocks the effects of c-kit. Using this drug in combination with chemotherapy may improve ability of the chemotherapy drugs to kill leukemia cells. This may then increase the chances of the leukemia going into complete remission.",,PHASE1/PHASE2,Oncology,leukemia,MeSH

All treatments will be performed until progression. Assessments will be made at least at the 2, 4 and 6 month timepoints and monthly thereafter until progression.~The purpose of this research study is to determine how much of the combination of Revlimid and Abraxane can be given safely and how well they work together against the cancer.~Currently, this trial is in the phase 1 stage.","Revlimid is an important imid based therapy of myeloma. However patients will still relapse after this drug and then have limited options. Abraxane has shown efficacy in a number of cancers, putatively through intratumor concentration by SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine). (Taxanes have shown a modest activity in myeloma. Interestingly, Revlimid can upregulate the levels of SPARC. Thus, investigators will test the toxicity and efficacy of a combination of Revlimid and Abraxane in relapsed/refractory myeloma.~Investigators will perform a phase I/II trial of Revlimid daily for 21 days and Abraxane weekly for 3 weeks in patients who have failed Revlimid but have adequate blood counts and renal function and minimal neuropathy.

No efficacy analyses were performed as the trial was terminated early with incomplete enrollment of \< 10%.~The purpose of this study is to determine if an investigational cell therapy called Cvac can help epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) from returning when administered to patients who are in complete remission after surgical removal of their tumor followed by standard first-line (Part A) or second-line (Part B) chemotherapy. Following remission, patients will undergo leukapheresis for the manufacture of the study agent. After completion of chemotherapy and confirmation of remission, patients will enter the treatment phase of the study.","This study proposes a nontoxic immunotherapeutic approach to extend overall survival in patients in complete remission. Most patients with ovarian cancer achieve complete clinical remission after optimal debulking surgery and first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. However, most patients, despite high response rates to first-line treatment, will relapse and undergo subsequent chemotherapy. Generally, the progression-free interval between treatments becomes shorter with each relapse, and the patient eventually dies of the disease.~For production of Cvac, each patient's cells were enriched using cell separation techniques. The patient's cells were cultured for 5 days with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in AIM V® serum-free tissue culture medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to cultivate the growth of dendritic cells (DC). The culture was pulsed overnight with the antigen (mannosylated mucin 1 fusion protein \[M-FP\]) to arm the DCs to the specific mucin 1 antigen. After harvesting, the M-FP-pulsed DCs were formulated as a finished product (Cvac) in 1 mL aliquots, diluted in 5% human serum albumin (HSA) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at an approximate concentration of 60 × 10\^6 viable DCs/mL. The vials were cryopreserved and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen at the manufacturing facility.~Different participants were enrolled in the 2 parts of the study.~Part A~To be eligible for participation, patients were diagnosed with stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer, underwent optimal debulking surgery (≤ 1 cm of residual disease), underwent platinum and taxane chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, and had a tumor that overexpressed mucin 1, as well as met all other study inclusion and exclusion criteria at screening.~Patients who met all study inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1:1 double-blinded fashion to either the Cvac (active) group or the placebo (control) group.

NCT02990143,The Effectiveness of Ologen® Collagen Matrix in Preventing Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Spikes After Ahmed Glaucoma Valve Surgery (AGV-FP7),Investigator left the Institution,Other/Unclear,"The purpose of this study is to investigate whether placing Ologen over the posterior plate of the Ahmed glaucoma drainage device during initial implantation will allow the formation of a thinner capsule, and decrease the incidence and/or the extent of IOP elevation during the postoperative period.","Uncontrolled glaucoma may require surgical intervention. Glaucoma drainage implants such as AGV-FP7 are in wide use upon glaucoma and comprehensive surgeons. The success of aqueous shunt surgery depends on the formation and maintenance of a thin permeable capsule around the posterior plate of the aqueous shunt. Encapsulated bleb formation, where the capsule is thick and elevated, is a common cause of drainage failure in the early post-operative period. This finding is usually accompanied by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which requires additional intervention, often surgical and therefore reduces the success rate of the initial surgery.~Recently, a biodegradable porous collagen-glycosaminoglycan copolymer matrix implant (Ologen), has become available for glaucoma surgery. This device is constructed so as to minimize random growth of fibroblasts and instead to allow them to grow through the pores in the matrix. Ologen® CM,a biodegradable scaffold matrix, induces a regenerative non-scarring wound healing process without using anti-fibrotic agents.~This study is to investigate whether placing Ologen over the posterior plate of the Ahmed glaucoma drainage device during initial implantation will allow the formation of a thinner capsule, and decrease the incidence and/or the extent of IOP elevation during the postoperative period.",PHASE2,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology disorder,MeSH

NCT01438112,Efficacy Study of Recombinant Adenovirus for Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer,Change in study design,Other/Unclear,The use of a designed viral vector that can destroy cancer cells while leaving normal cells largely unharmed. The virus also stimulates an immunological response by producing a special factor (GM-CSF) to attract and promote the development of dendritic and T effector cells. It forms the hypothesis that this regimen may be used for people who have failed current forms of treatment and are recommended for cystectomy. It is with hope that this novel therapy will be able to delay or potentially avoid cystectomy for this patient population. Bladder instillation of this agent causes little long lasting side effects and may drastically improve the stimulation of the immune system for local cancer cell death as well as destroying those tumor cells that may have travelled to regional lymph nodes or distant organs.,"After the phase I/II CG0070 trial review, it became apparent that the use of CG0070 oncolytic vaccine as an intravesical agent for oncolytic lysis of tumor cells, together with the transcription of GM-CSF on site, may have distinct advantages. This first study showed excellent tumor response rates of 48-77% depending on the dose schedule administered. All of these patients had residual non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who have previously failed BCG therapy at the time of treatment.~With the addition of a transduction agent such as DDM, the intravesical instillation of CG0070 enabled uniform distribution of viral particles and exposure to the tumor during those 30-60 minutes instillations as contrast to the intra-tumor injection, intra-arterial or intravenous injection of viral particles in other oncolytic viral trials. Some or most of these delivering methodologies have obvious intrinsic imperfections and potential toxicity. This unique opportunity of an relatively easy intravesical tumor exposure is difficult to duplicate in other solid tumor models.~The replication of CG0070 in the majority of patients during the first phase I/II trial indicated tumor lysis with release of tumor specific or tumor associated antigens that have been stably expressed, in abundant quantities during tumor cell death. Release of tumor antigens have been the key elements, together with sufficient on-site GM-CSF, in stimulating strong cross-presentation and confirmation signals to the antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells interacting with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This concept of a real time vaccine like regimen is expected to compare favorably with other forms of cancer immunotherapy treatment such as BCG in this patient population.~It is with this thought that CG0070 may find a success in this setting because of a reasonably and proven complete response rate in residual and failed BCG bladder cancer patients in the first phase I/II study (some cases with only one instillation). Of importance as well, is the demonstration in the study data of a strong GM-CSF expression during its replication phase. Those patients with carcinoma in situ disease and those with RB pathway dysfunction were particularly responsive.~It is therefore, desirable to formulate a protocol to encompass the specialty of this oncolytic vaccine and the unique intravesical delivery to prove the efficacy by a randomized controlled study. This opportunity allows a study on the CG0070's beneficial effects, if any, on the standard of care for carcinoma in situ non muscle invasive bladder cancer patients after they failed BCG therapy. The prognosis of this group presently depends mainly on early radical cystectomy, which carries a high morbidity and decrease of quality of life generally viewed as unacceptable for this group of older patients.",PHASE2/PHASE3,Oncology,Other cancer,MeSH

NCT00909363,Thrombocytopenia and Bleeding in Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) Patients,retirement of PI,Other/Unclear,The purpose of this project is to describe the pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia and bleeding in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) and determine the response to thrombopoietic agents in vitro and in vivo.,"Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome is an X-linked disease characterized by immunodeficiency, eczema and thrombocytopenia; a milder form of the disease known as X-Linked thrombocytopenia also exists. The thrombocytopenia in both WAS and XLT is characterized by: severe thrombocytopenia with platelet counts frequently less than 10-30,000/ul; small platelets which may be dysfunctional; and, as a result, a high rate of serious bleeding including intracranial hemorrhage.~Because eltrombopag has been shown to be remarkably efficacious in substantially increasing platelet counts in a high percentage of ITP patients, this study seeks to effectively treat patients who exhibit similar pathologies, as well as evaluate the state of platelets in patients with WAS and relate it to clinical bleeding. It also aims to demonstrate whether eltrombopag administered daily will enhance stem cell function, increase platelet production and platelet count, and reduce bleeding in patients with WAS.",PHASE2,Hematology,Hematology disorder,MeSH
NCT00519831,Ph II of Vinflunine and Cetuximab in Second Line Treatment of NSCLC,Drug unavailable,Other/Unclear,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinflunine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving vinflunine together with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.~PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vinflunine together with cetuximab works as second-line therapy in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.","OBJECTIVES:~Primary~* Estimate the objective response rate in patients receiving vinflunine and cetuximab as second-line therapy for stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.~Secondary~* Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.~* Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.~* Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.~* Determine the duration of overall response in these patients.~OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.~Patients receive vinflunine IV over 15-20 minutes on day 1 and cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.

NCT00204152,Treatment for Chronic Depression,PI left U of C,Other/Unclear,"The purpose of this study is to test the clinical efficacy of two psychotherapies for early onset chronic major depression, including Behavioral Activation (Jacobson et al., 2001), and an integrated version of Behavioral Activation and Stress Innoculation Coping (BASIC) for short-term (16 weeks) of individual psychotherapy for adults with chronic major depression. The control condition is an individual workbook condition of Behavioral Activation. These psychotherapies focus on behavior activation, stress reduction and coping strategies to counter depressive symptoms.","Early-onset unipolar major depression is linked with considerable morbidity and mortality (Birmaher et al., 1996). The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of Behavioral Activation (BA; Jacobson et al., 2001) and an integrated version of Behavioral Activation (BA + Stress Inoculation Coping; BASIC) for the short-term psychotherapy of adults with chronic major depression (onset before age 18) and a history of early life stress before age 18. Exposure to stress during the developmental years has been linked with early-onset depression (Rao et al., 1996), a propensity to generate stress during the life span (Hammen et al., 1998), and a greater psychological sensitivity to stress as an adult (Post et al., 1992). And while incidence of early life stress is high among depressed adults, there are no behavioral treatments designed to address the unique needs of these individuals. We aim to develop a new treatment for a specific group of depressed patients, namely individuals who report early onset of depression and early life stress. We include the critical elements of behavioral activation and stress reduction strategies to address the avoidance, stress sensitivities, and coping deficits often observed in this population.~The specific aims are: 1) to determine if the addition of stress reduction strategies (packaged in BASIC) enhance the effects of BA, as indexed by the rate early remission; 2) to investigate if exposure to BA and BASIC reduce risk of relapse within three months of treatment termination, as indexed by reduced rates of relapse by the 3-month follow-up; and, 3) to learn if effects of BA are mediated by changes in activity behaviors or the acquisition of compensatory behavioral skills, and likewise whether enduring effects of BASIC are mediated by changes in stress regulation or the acquisition of stress regulation skills. Our approach is to compare BA and BASIC to a self-guided bibliotherapy of BA (control condition) using a randomized clinical trial design to distinguish between conditions. We anticipate that this study will promote our understanding about the efficacy of BA and the discovery of mechanisms of treatment response. We expect this project to facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms that promote treatment gains and contribute to depressive relapse.",PHASE3,Psychiatry,Psychiatry disorder,MeSH
NCT03628079,A Clinical Safety and Efficacy Study of Mebendazole on GI Cancer or Cancer of Unknown Origin.,Lack of effect,Other/Unclear,"This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of mebendazole (ReposMBZ) in patient with advanced gastrointestinal cancer or cancer of unknown origin. All patients will be given ReposMBZ for 16 weeks continuous treatment, individually dosed based on the serum concentration of mebendazole.",Mebendazole has been used extensively during long time for local gut helminthic infections at low dose but also at considerably higher doses during months to years against invasive echinococcus infections. Recent research has now clearly indicated that mebendazole has anticancer effect. Given these observations and the experience of excellent tolerance to mebendazole the current clinical trial protocol is based on the repositioning strategy to more extensively investigate whether mebendazole could be developed into a useful anticancer drug.,PHASE1/PHASE2,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology disorder,MeSH
NCT02525302,HT-100 Long-term Study in DMD Patients Who Completed HALO-DMD-02,Dosing stopped,Other/Unclear,"This study, HALO-DMD-03, is a follow-on study to HALO-DMD-01 and HALO-DMD-02, and allows continued open-label access to HT-100 for subjects who have completed these studies. HALO-DMD-03 will provide safety and strength and function data on continuous long-term dosing. Data from this study will be used to inform the safety, tolerability, and dose selection for a future trial of HT-100 in boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).","As a follow-on study to the initial clinical studies of HT-100 in DMD (Protocols HALO-DMD-01 and HALO-DMD-02), this open-label study is designed to provide data on continuous long-term dosing. Subjects will be entered into the study without cessation of dosing, in a staggered fashion, into the same cohort assignment they had in the predecessor studies. Up to 30 subjects who have completed dosing in HALO-DMD-02 will be offered the opportunity to continue on the same dose regimen until market approval of HT-100 or termination of the study by the Sponsor. Reasons for termination could include, among others, safety concerns or lack of efficacy, based on analysis of combined data from all HT-100 studies. Safety data from subjects approaching the end the HALO-DMD-02 participation will be individually reviewed by the Medical Monitor and the subject's physician (Principal Investigator \[PI\]). If the Medical Monitor and the PI agree there are no clinically significant safety signals (absence of clinically significant laboratory or clinical abnormalities to date), the subject will be considered eligible and offered continuation of dosing. To avoid an interruption in dosing, subjects will immediately be screened for participation and enrolled upon completing the predecessor trial, HALO-DMD-02. Participation is in this study HALO-DMD-03 is optional. Safety and pharmacodynamics (PD) monitoring will continue throughout the subject's study participation.

NCT00346151,Belatacept to Prevent Organ Rejection in Kidney Transplant Patients,Stopping rule-acute rejection threshold-was met based on local biopsy results,Other/Unclear,"Belatacept is an experimental medication shown in clinical trials to have immune system suppression properties in people who have had renal (e.g., kidney) transplants. This study will determine whether a combination of anti-rejection drugs, including belatacept, can prevent the rejection of a first-time, non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical renal transplant and allow patients to be safely withdrawn from anti-rejection therapy one year post-transplant.","Drugs that suppress the immune system have contributed to increased success of transplantation; however, to prevent organ rejection, transplant recipients need to take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives. These drugs make patients more susceptible to infection and certain kinds of cancer. Belatacept is an experimental medication that specifically targets immune reactions against transplanted organs and has been shown to be effective in preventing kidney transplant rejection in previous clinical trials. Both thymoglobulin, an antibody, and sirolimus, an anti-rejection drug, prevent rejection by lowering the response of the immune system to the transplanted organ. This study will evaluate whether belatacept, along with thymoglobulin and sirolimus, is safe in kidney transplant patients. The study will also evaluate this regimen's potential to allow tapering and eventual discontinuation of all immunosuppressive drugs.~This study will last up to 4 years. At the time of transplant, participants will begin an immunosuppressive treatment regimen consisting of thymoglobulin, sirolimus, and belatacept. Participants will receive infusions of thymoglobulin on days 1 through 4, and a combination of oral sirolimus (daily) and belatacept infusions at day 5, then weeks 2, 4, 8, and monthly for at least 2 years. Dose reduction of belatacept will occur at 12 weeks post-transplant. At Year 2, eligible participants may choose to begin drug withdrawal or continue study therapy through the end of the study. Study visits will occur weekly for the first two months, then monthly. These visits will include belatacept treatment, general medical assessments, blood and urine collection, and other assessments to determine overall health of the recipient's immune system and kidney transplant and to better understand the way the immune system works in the acceptance or rejection of organ transplants.~\*\*\* IMPORTANT NOTICE: \*\*\* The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Immune Tolerance Network do not recommend the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy for recipients of cell, organ, or tissue transplants outside of physician-directed, controlled clinical studies. Discontinuation of prescribed immunosuppressive therapy can result in serious health consequences and should only be performed in certain rare circumstances, upon the recommendation and with the guidance of your health care provider.",PHASE2,Nephrology,Nephrology disorder,Condition
