NCT04566133,Combination of Trametinib (MEK Inhibitor) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (Autophagy Inhibitor) in Patients With KRAS Mutation Refractory Bile Tract Carcinoma (BTC).,Slow accrual,"Background:~Bile duct cancer is cancer of the slender tubes of the biliary tract. These tubes carry bile through the liver. Such cancer tumors often have an abnormal or mutated gene. Researchers think a mix of drugs can slow the progression of gene-mutated cancers of the biliary tract.~Objective:~To see if using a combination of trametinib and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) increases the period of time it takes for a person s bile tract carcinoma (BTC) to get worse.~Eligibility:~Adults age 18 and older with BTC.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and cancer history. Their ability to do their normal activities will be assessed. They will have blood and urine tests. They will give a tumor sample. They will have heart tests. They may talk with a heart doctor. They may have an eye exam. They may have a tuberculosis test. They will have computer tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They may have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis.~Participants will repeat some screening tests throughout the study.~Participants will take HCQ and trametinib tablets by mouth daily in 28-day cycles. They will have study visits once a month. They will take the drugs until they have bad side effects or the drugs stop working.~Participants will have one more tumor biopsy during the treatment. They will have blood taken often.~One month after treatment ends, participants will have a safety follow-up visit. Then they will be called or emailed every 6 months for the rest of their life....","Background:~* Among the new cases of bile tract carcinoma (BTC) that are diagnosed every year in the United States, there are approximately 6,500 cases of gallbladder carcinoma, 3,000 cases of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 3,000 cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.~* Current treatment options for patients with cholangiocarcinoma are limited and take no account of the known biological and genetic heterogeneity in these diseases. Median survival for advanced disease remains poor at approximately 1 year.~* Activating kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutations are frequently detected in all subtypes of BTC and can be found in up to 40% of BTC, predominantly in perihilar and distal cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). However, pharmacological inhibition of mutated KRAS has demonstrated little clinical benefit in general.~* Trametinib is a reversible, highly selective allosteric inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinases methyl ethyl ketone 1 (MEK1) and methyl ethyl ketone 2 (MEK2). Tumor cells with KRAS mutations commonly have hyperactivated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathways in which activated MEK is a critical component. However, tumors are able to overcome MEK signaling inhibition by trametinib through upregulation of autophagy pathway.~* Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) inhibits lysosomal acidification and prevents the degradation of autophagosomes, to suppress autophagy.~* Trametinib has been approved by FDA for the treatment of melanoma as a single agent or for the treatment of other cancers if tumors carry BRAF mutation. Hydroxychloroquine is approved for the treatment of malaria, lupus erythematosus and acute or chronic rheumatoid arthritis.~* Preclinical studies have shown that combined treatment of trametinib plus HCQ elicited striking tumor regression in animal model.~Objective:~-To determine whether the 5-month progression free survival (PFS) of the trametinib plus hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) combination in subjects with refractory bile tract carcinoma (BTC) with KRAS mutation exceeds 25%.~Eligibility:~* Histopathological confirmation of BTC or carcinoma highly suggestive of a diagnosis of BTC.~* Tumor must have KRAS mutation.~* Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection, transplantation or ablation.~* Age greater than or equal to 18 years~* Patients must have measurable lesion by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.~* At least two weeks washout period from previous therapy~* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) less than or equal to 2~* Adequate renal, hepatic and bone marrow function~Design:~-The study is open-labeled phase 2 study. It is designed to enroll total 30 patients with refractory BTC, to test the hypothesis that treatment with a combination of HCQ and trametinib prevents cancer progression/recurrence. We propose that this combination will have relative safety profile and antitumor efficacy in BTC patients with KRAS mutation."
NCT02815488,"A Study to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Single and Repeat Doses of CHF6297 in Healthy Subjects and Patients With COPD",Very poor recruitment in the Part 4 of the study,"CHF6297 is a potent and selective inhibitor of human MAP kinase p38 being developed as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of inflammatory airways diseases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and repeat doses of CHF6297 as dry powder formulation in healthy subjects and in COPD patients. This study is the first administration in humans.~The study will comprise four parts:~Part 1 will consist of two cohorts of healthy male subjects to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Single Ascending Dose (SAD) of CHF6297.~Part 2 will consist of four cohorts of healthy male subjects to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) of CHF6297.~Part 3 will consist of one cohort of COPD patients to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a repeat dose of CHF6297~Part 4 will consist of one cohort of healthy subjects to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of a repeat dose of CHF6297 after LPS challenge.",
NCT02721888,Effect of Liraglutide on Fatty Liver Content and Lipoprotein Metabolism,Failure of inclusion,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is commonly associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. NAFLD, in patients with type 2 diabetes, has been shown to be associated with lipid abnormalities (such as hypertriglyceridemia and decreased HDL-cholesterol) and increased cardiovascular risk. Such lipid abnormalities (hypertriglyceridemia and decreased HDL-cholesterol) are very frequent in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, NAFLD is a risk for further development of cirrhosis (estimated between 3 and 5%).~Animal studies have shown that liraglutide is able to decrease liver fat content, but the effect of liraglutide on liver fat content in patients with diabetes remains unknown.~In addition, human studies with liraglutide have shown significant modification of plasma lipids, such as reduction of plasma triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol. However, the mechanisms responsible for these liraglutide induced lipid modifications are not yet known.~Because increased in liver fat content and hypertriglyceridemia are associated in patients with type 2 diabetes, it seems interesting to study the effect of liraglutide on both liver fat content and lipid metabolism using gold-standard methods (proton-spectroscopy for liver fat content assessment and kinetic study with stable isotope to study lipoprotein metabolism).~This is a monocentric study. Fatty liver content will be performed by proton-spectroscopy in patients with type 2 diabetes (n=120) before and after a 6 month period of liraglutide therapy (1.2 mg/day).~Moreover, an in vivo kinetic study will be performed with stable isotopes (13C leucine) in 10 patients among the 120 patients with type 2 diabetes (n=10) before and after a 6-month period of liraglutide (1.2 mg/day) therapy. Each kinetic study will be performed during a 2-day hospitalization~For the main study, 3 visits will be performed:~* a first visit at T0, before starting the treatment with liraglutide, including clinical and biological measurements and liver fat content assessment by proton-spectroscopy~* a visit at 3 months including clinical and biological measurements~* and a visit at 6 months including clinical and biological measurements and liver fat content assessment by proton-spectroscopy~For the kinetic substudy, performed in 10 patients, a kinetic study with stable isotope will been performs during a 48h-hospitalization before starting the treatment with liraglutide and after 6 month-treatment with liraglutide",
NCT01760304,Changes in Cardiac Function in COPD Patients After Administration of Budesonide/Formoterol (Symbicort®) Versus Placebo,Sponsor decided to stop the study due to expiration of blinded placebo .,To investigate whether Budesonide/Formoterol (Symbicort ®) therapy can improve heart function at rest by decreasing lung hyperinflation in patients with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).,"Patients with moderate to advanced COPD are known to have static hyperinflation (at rest) as a consequence of expiratory flow limitation. Hyperinflation is easily detected by measuring lung volumes during standard pulmonary function testing.~Decreased Inspiratory Capacity (IC) secondary to hyperinflation has been described as a predictor of mortality in COPD, and as a limiting factor for the maximal tidal volume attained during exercise. Hyperinflation has been linked to a low cardiac output in part by limiting left ventricular ejection fraction during exercise.~Treatment with inhaled anticholinergic agents or long-acting beta agonists (LABA) and combination of the LABA formoterol and budesonide has been shown to improve IC and decrease lung hyperinflation. Bronchodilators have been shown to improve exercise endurance in COPD when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation, however the exact mechanism: improvement of lung mechanics and /or improvement in cardiac function is not well known.~Impedance cardiography (ICG) has emerged as a method to measure cardiac output without the need for invasive devices. Cardiac output measurement by impedance cardiography (CO-ICG) is a valid and reproducible method. It has been shown to have good correlation with thermodilution and the direct Fick method for the measurement of stroke volume and cardiac output.~In addition, the oxygen pulse, easily obtained by dividing the measured oxygen uptake by the heart rate (VO2/HR) provides an adequate reflection of cardiac stroke volume when the systemic extraction of oxygen is stable.~This method has been used to evaluate the effect of static and dynamic hyperinflation on cardiac function.~This pilot study is designed to be a single center (Brigham and Women's Hospital), randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover study of 14 patients (male and female 40 to 80 years old) with COPD and static hyperinflation.~The primary endpoint is the measurement of stroke volume, cardiac output and oxygen pulse at rest before and after the administration of budesonide/formoterol compared to placebo."

The study will also assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of BIIB092 on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) N-terminal tau, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of BIIB092 in participants with PSP.","This study, previously posted by Bristol-Myers Squibb, has transitioned to Biogen under a licensing agreement."
NCT03299881,Safety and Effectiveness of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)-Assisted Weight Loss,Early termination due to technical problems with the device.,"This study is a randomized, adaptive, parallel arm study. The treatment group will receive the Elira wearable patch system and provided instructions for use and advised to follow a 1200 calorie diet. The control group will be asked to follow a 12 calorie diet only. Each group will be followed for 12 weeks. Total body weight loss will be measured as well as appetite changes. Safety data will be collected throughout the study period. Safety and effectiveness will be determined based on differences between the groups.","This study employs a randomized, adaptive, parallel arm study in which, cohorts of enrolled subjects (25 per arm) are assessed for dose response and progression to achievement of primary and secondary endpoints. Enrollment will be up to 300 subjects at 4 US centers.~After signing informed consent, subjects will be screened during a one week screening/baseline period to determine if they meet the inclusion criteria and exhibit none of the exclusion criteria. Weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, HgA1c, pregnancy test (for women of childbearing age), and patient questionnaires will be collected. If eligible, subjects will be randomized to treatment or control groups. The treatment group will receive training on the Elira Wearable Patch System and the first TENS session will be administered in the investigators office. Both groups will receive an electronic scale and instructions on 1200 calorie diet as well as diary completion requirements to be completed throughout the study. All subjects will be required to have in office follow-up visits every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Up to 2 additional follow-up visits will be permitted within that 12 week time period."
NCT00552578,Buprenorphine as a Treatment in Opiate Dependent Pain Patients,Tapering doses protocol arm was not effective for treatment retention outcome.,"This study is designed to determine if different doses of buprenorphine (either tapering doses or steady doses) are effective in managing chronic, non-cancer pain in individuals who also are addicted to opiate pain medicines.","Context: Some individuals have two conditions: 1) a well-documented pain disorder and 2) clear evidence of a substance use disorder with opiate dependency. It is not known how to manage these patients. In addition to other modalities for the treatment of chronic pain, combination tablets of buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) may be helpful.~Objective: The objective of this study is to determine if the addition of pharmacotherapy with Suboxone to usual care would improve clinical outcome relative to usual care alone.~Design: Randomized control trial.~Setting: The study will be conducted in the out-patient clinics of a tertiary-care teaching hospital.~Participants: The participants will be those who have: 1) a well-documented pain disorder and 2) clear evidence of a substance use disorder with opiate dependency.~Baseline data collected: Data collected at baseline will include (with examples): demographics (age, gender, race), substance use history (type of substances used, duration of use, routes of abuse), type of pain disorder (previous traumatic injury, musculoskeletal, neuropathic), co-existing medical problems (seizures, hepatitis C), prior injuries (accidents, interpersonal violence), prior mental health problems (prior treatment, diagnoses), prior substance abuse treatment (outpatient, inpatient), socioeconomic variables (educational level, occupation, employment history), criminal history (number of arrests and convictions, total amount of time spent in jail or prison), family history (first degree relatives with substance use disorders) and scores on psychometric testing (ASI).~Outcome data: Three main outcome variables will be examined relapse to substance use (as documented by toxicology), quality of life, and successful participation in the pain management program for six months, which included the completion of the study buprenorphine treatment protocols.~Data analyses: Outcome variables will be compared between the two groups using t-tests or chi-square tests as appropriate. A Kaplan-Myer survival analysis will be used to describe participant participation. Predictors of poor outcomes will be identified using a case-control design in which those with poor outcomes (the cases) will be compared to those with successful outcomes (the controls) using multivariate techniques (logistic regression)."
NCT00724685,Interest of Continuous Ropivacaine Administration Through an Elastomeric Pump (Pain Buster) for the Surgery of Latissimus Dorsi and Serratus Micro Anastomotic Flaps,,"Continuous bupivacaine administration through an elastomeric pump (Pain Buster) has been found effective for post operative analgesia in a large range of surgery. Ropivacaine is a less toxic drug, never tested in the surgery of latissimus dorsi and serratus micro anastomotic flaps (from the investigators knowledge). The aim of the study is to evaluate the usefulness of this drug and device for post operative analgesia, associated with patient controlled analgesia with morphine. For this purpose a controlled randomized double blind trial against placebo (saline) is performed, enrolling 40 (20x2) patients during 3 years, in order to measure total morphine consumption during the first 48 post operative hours and to evaluate analgesia and sides effects of morphine in each group.",
NCT00359294,A Phase I Study of Zalypsis (PM00104) in Subjects With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors or Lymphoma,Low recruitment,"Phase I trial, dose escalating, prospective, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study. The purpose is to determine the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended dose (RD) of PM00104, administered intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5 days every 3 weeks (this is considered as 1 cycle) to subjects with advanced malignant solid tumors or lymphoma.","Phase I trial, dose escalating, prospective, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study.

NCT00155883,Bi-Weekly Docetaxel Plus 24-Hour Infusion of High-Dose 5-Fluorouracil / Leucovorin (HDFL) for Inoperable Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer,slow a accrul due to many competitive trials.,The primary objective is to determine the tumor response rate of bi-weekly docetaxel plus 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-FU/leucovorin chemotherapy for patients with inoperable advanced gastric cancer.,"Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in Taiwan. We have previously demonstrated that weekly 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Our in vitro and clinical studies suggested that long (24 hours or more) infusion of 5-FU/leucovorin may, compared with the conventional bolus regimens, enhance its anti-tumor activity in gastric cancer by prolonging suppression of thymidylate synthase, the target enzyme of 5-FU cytotoxicity. Docetaxel, a mitotic inhibitor, has good single-agent activity against gastric cancer, with a tumor response rate around 20 to 24%. Preliminary clinical data indicate that a biweekly administration of docetaxel will reduce the incidence of neutropenia and asthenia, two most bothersome side effects of tri-weekly and weekly docetaxel, respectively, while maintaining its anti-tumor activity. This phase II trial is designed to test the efficacy and toxicity of biweekly docetaxel and 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-FU/leucovorin as first-line therapy for patients with inoperable advanced gastric cancer."
NCT00947388,Bendamustine Plus Alemtuzumab for Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL),No more eligible patients,"This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alemtuzumab when given together with bendamustine hydrochloride in treating patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) that did not respond to fludarabine phosphate. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can also block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving bendamustine hydrochloride together with alemtuzumab may kill more cancer cells.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:~I.

NCT00853489,rhBMP-2 Versus Autograft in Critical Size Tibial Defects,Enrollment too slow,The purpose of our study is to evaluate the use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (RhBMP-2) as compared to standard ICBG in the treatment of severe open tibia fractures with a critical size bone defect (at least one centimeter in length compromising at least 50% of the circumference of the bone).,"Open tibia fractures have a 15% or higher rate of not healing. Those fractures which do not heal are typically treated with bone from the hip (iliac crest autograft; or ICBG). The use of ICBG bone with the treatment of delayed unions/non-unions with critical defect, although successful, has its drawbacks. The bone graft sources are limited and the procedure is associated with additional operating room time plus a second incision with increased risk of infection, post operative pain and increased hospital stay. The purpose of this study is to determine if Rh-BMP2, a new bone graft substitute, is at least as effective as using bone from the hip (autograft) to help promote healing of open, tibia (shin bone) fractures.~Research Questions:~Primary:~What is the relative effect of rhBMP-2 versus autogenous ICBG on rates of union in patients with critical size defects following tibial shaft fractures?~Null hypothesis #1: rhBMP-2 has the same union rate when used in critical-sized defects as does ICBG.~Secondary:~What is the relative effect of rhBMP-2 versus autogenous ICBG on infection rates in patients with nonunion or critical size defects following tibial shaft fractures?~Null hypothesis #2: The infection rate in open tibias with critical-sized defects treated with rhBMP-2 and autogenous ICBG are the same.~What is the economic impact of the use of Rh-BMP 2 for tibial fractures with critical sized defects?~Null hypothesis #3: There will be no difference in the economic cost of the treatment of critical sized defects using the RhBMP-2 versus iliac crest bone graft."

NCT00493025,"Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, Gefitinib, and Radiation Therapy Followed by Surgery and Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Cancer of the Esophagus or Gastroesophageal Junction That Can Be Removed By Surgery",Closed due to early stopping rule-Low accrual,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving these treatments before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving gefitinib after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.~PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel, cisplatin, gefitinib, and radiation therapy followed by surgery and gefitinib works in treating patients with locally advanced cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction that can be removed by surgery.","OBJECTIVES:~Primary~* Determine the pathologic complete response rate in patients with resectable, locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with neoadjuvant paclitaxel, cisplatin, gefitinib, and radiotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant gefitinib.~Secondary~* Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.~* Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.~* Determine time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.~* Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of unbound gefitinib in these patients.~* Conduct exploratory studies to determine if EGFR pathway component expression and activation correlates with response to therapy and survival of these patients.~* Determine if treatment with gefitinib alters the EGFR pathway in these patients.~OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.~* Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients receive oral gefitinib beginning 14 days prior to the start of chemoradiotherapy and continuing until 7 days prior to surgery (10-12 weeks). Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 2-3 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Patients also undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks.~* Surgery: Patients undergo surgical resection 4-6 weeks after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy.~* Adjuvant therapy: Patients receive gefitinib once a day beginning 2-8 weeks after surgery and continuing for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.~Blood samples are obtained at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic studies. Tumor tissue samples are obtained by core biopsy at baseline for biomarker correlative studies. Samples are analyzed by IHC to measure expression and activation of EGFR-signaling pathway biomarkers in pretreatment esophageal tumor tissue, including EGFR and phosphorylated (p)-EGFR, ERK and p-ERK, Akt and p-Akt, p70s6k and p-p70s6k, and p27.~After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years."
NCT00586274,Use of Rft5-Dga to Deplete Alloreactive Cells for Pts With Fanconi Anemia After Haploidentical SCT,Poor accrual,"While stem cell transplantation has proven an effective means of treating a wide variety of diseases involving hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny, a shortage of donors has proved a major impediment to the widest application of the approach. Until recently, only MHC identical donors could be used with safety. Such donors were originally siblings or other closely related family members. Over the past decade, the growth of allogeneic donor panels has allowed transplantation with stem cells obtained from a volunteer donor panel.~While it is now possible to obtain HLA identical unrelated donor stem cells for approximately 75% of individuals of Northern European backgrounds, the situation for most other ethnic groups is much less satisfactory. Even when a matched donor can be found, the elapsed time between commencing the search and collecting the stem cells usually exceeds three months, a delay that may doom many of the neediest patients. Hence there has been considerable interest in making use of HLA haploidentical family donors. Most individuals have a first-degree relative who would be suitable for such protocols. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the development of progressive aplastic anemia usually evident by about age seven years and often associated with various diverse congenital anomalies such as short stature, microcephaly, radial anomalies, horseshoe kidney, and cafe au lait spots.~This study will determine the number of donor lymphocytes that can be given to recipients of haploidentical stem cell transplants with Fanconi anemia after depletion of recipient-reactive T lymphocytes by ex-vivo treatment with a fixed dose of RFT5-dgA immunotoxin, and will result in a rate of Grade III/IV GVHD of \< / = 25%.","Patients will have received a haplo-identical stem cell transplant on our on-going study CD45 (YTH-24 and YTH-54) and CD52 (Campath 1H) Monoclonal Antibody Conditioning Regimen for Allogeneic Donor Stem Cell Transplantation of Patients with Fanconi Anemia (H-9938 IND# 7233) and will become eligible to receive allodepleted T Cells following engraftment.

NCT03534505,Post-Operative Analgesic Effects of Local Wound Infiltration With Ketorolac After Inguinal Herniorrhaphy,cannot enroll patient,"Inguinal hernia is one of the most common diseases worldwide, including Thailand. Patients who underwent treatment of inguinal hernia (herniorrhaphy) found surgical site pain.There are many procedures to relieve pain after surgery. Injection of pain killer at the surgical site is a well-known method nowadays, especially with NSAIDs; Nowadays, Ketorolac is among the most-often used drug in the research. B. Ben-David's et al. published in 1995. is the study of the effects of the Ketorolac by comparing 60 mg of Ketorolac injected intramuscularly and 30 mg injections at the surgical site in 32 patients who underwent herniorrhaphy. Observing patients after surgery, postoperative pain score at 2 and 6. After 24 hours of surgery, they found that the patients who were given Ketorolac 30 mg suffered less pain than the group of patients who had Ketorolac 60 mg with statistical significant (P\<0.05). The study by Connelly and colleagues, published in 1997, was a randomized double-blind study which compared the performance of relieving pain after surgery of surgical site injection of Ketorolac 60 mg and intravenous injection of Ketorolac 60 mg. In studies of 30 patients with herniorrhaphy surgery, the results showed within 24 hours of surgery, the group of patients with surgical site injections suffered less pain than the group of patients with intravenous injection (P\<0.02). Besides they discovered that the time to first analgesia in the group of patients with surgical site injection was longer. (P\<0.03), and the amount of analgesic requirement that the patients needed in the first 24 hours after surgery was also less in this group. (P\<0.0002). According to the research above surgical site injection of Ketorolac is effective in pain relief. Bupivacaine is the most accepted drug using local infiltratively to relieve the pain especially in patients with herniorrhaphy. Previous studies of Bupivacaine found that Bupivacaine is a very effective in pain reliever, can reduce the usage of opioids, and also can reduce the recovery time in hospital. Thus, our study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of pain relief after surgery by local infiltration of Ketorolac in a patients who undergo herniorrhaphy by dividing patients into two groups and comparing between Ketorolac and Bupivacaine injection at surgical site.","The study design is a prospective randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of patients who are undergoing elective unilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy at Ramathibodi Hospital during the period 1 July 2018 - 30 June 2020 The primary outcome is to study the effectiveness of Ketorolac injections in pain relief after herniorrhaphy surgery and the secondary outcome is to study the adverse effects and complications after injection of Ketorolac: anaphylactic shock, abnormal bleeding at surgical wound, gastrointestinal bleeding and acute kidney injury.~After approval by the ethics committee, patients scheduled for elective unilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy under general anesthesia who are eligible for inclusion criteria will be recruited for this study after informed consent by surgical residents or surgical staff at the Out Patient Department (OPD). Patients who meet the exclusion criteria will be excluded.~During a preoperative visit, the patients will be introduced to the concept of the visual analogue scale (VAS), which ranges from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain.~Once given general anesthesia in the operating room, the patient will be randomly selected into one of the two arms of this report's diagram (1:1 ratio) through the drawing of a sealed, opaque envelope by one of the surgical residents in charge or by the attending surgeon. All patients will undergo herniorrhaphy with Lichtenstein Tension-Free Repair technique. After abdominal sheath will be closed by Vicryl No.0, Patients who are the Ketorolac group will receive local infiltration in abdominal sheath layer with Ketorolac 30 mg in normal saline 10 ml. and patients who are the control group will receive local infiltration with 0.5% bupivacaine 10 ml. And then skin closure will be done by nylon 3-0.~A standardized plan for postoperative analgesia is prepared. All patients will receive one 500 mg tablet of oral paracetamol every 6 hours when postoperative oral intake is allowed by the attending doctor. In patients with VAS scores \>3, parenteral opioid (Morphine) is given.~The hospital volunteer nurses caring for the patients during the preoperative and postoperative course are given standard pain evaluation protocols. All study pain evaluators and patients are blinded to treatment assignments throughout the pain assessment process.~After the operation, the inpatient ward nurse will record the patients' pain scores at 4,8, and 12 hours after surgery using the VAS score and record the results in the study data recording form attached to each patient's medical record chart. Additional morphine usage data is also recorded.~All adverse effects and complications after injection of Ketorolac injection such as anaphylactic shock, abnormal bleeding at surgical wound, gastrointestinal bleeding and acute kidney injury will be recorded and treated by the attending resident or consultant doctor. All data is collected by the main investigator from the patient chart and data recording form. Data is expressed as mean ± SD. Parametric data is compared between groups.

NCT04376567,Outcomes for One-stage and Two-stage Brachial Basilic Arteriovenous Fistulas,The PI is leaving the institution and the trial will be not resuming.,"An arteriovenous (AV) fistula is essential for patients with kidney failure on dialysis. There is no clear data on the best method to create a new brachial basilic AV fistula (BBAVF), so the choice between a single procedure and two separate procedures is left to the surgeon. Both approaches are standard care. This study aims to compare patient-centered outcomes and quality of life by randomly assigning patients needing a BBAVF to either a one-stage or two-stage procedure.","The aim of the pilot trial is to compare the outcomes of patients with end stage kidney failure (ESKD) who are candidates for a new brachial basilic arteriovenous fistula (BBAVF). Patients will be randomized to either one-stage or two-stage BBAVF procedure, both standard of care for creating BBAVF. The main outcome will be primary clinical functional patency, defined as successful use of BBAVF over a continuous 4-week period without any need for additional procedure on the BBAVF. The secondary outcomes are fistula-related complications, duration of central venous catheter (CVC) for those on dialysis, and quality of life (QoL) measures. The study hypothesizes that the primary patency will be superior following the two-stage BBAVF procedure compare to one-stage procedure. However, CVC-related complications are expected to be higher following the two-stage procedure compared to the one-stage procedure. Patient will be followed for a minimum duration of 12-months per subject."
NCT00995501,"The Effects of Corticosteroids, Glucose Control, and Depth-of-Anesthesia on Perioperative Inflammation and Morbidity From Major Non-cardiac Surgery (Dexamethasone, Light Anesthesia and Tight Glucose Control (DeLiT Trial))","Per interim analysis, for futility.","Evidence thus suggests that steroid administration, tight glucose control, and avoidance of deep anesthesia may decrease perioperative morbidity by reducing the inflammatory response to surgery. Using a three-way factorial approach, the investigators thus propose to test the primary hypotheses that major perioperative morbidity is reduced by: 1) low-dose dexamethasone; 2) intensive perioperative glucose control; and 3) lighter anesthesia.~Secondary hypotheses include that each intervention reduces circulating concentrations of the inflammatory marker CRP, and that there is a correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) and post-operative complications. Anesthetic sensitivity predicts major and minor complications, and delirium Other secondary hypotheses are that each intervention, reduces minor surgical complications, reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), reduces postoperative delirium, speeds hospital discharge, improves quality of life (SF-12v2 Health Survey, Christensen's VAS fatigue score), and reduces all-cause one-year mortality.","The perioperative period is characterized by an intense inflammatory response marked by elevated concentrations of inflammatory markers like C-Reactive Protein (CRP). This response has been linked to increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. Available evidence suggests that blunting the inflammatory response to surgical trauma might improve perioperative outcomes. The putative benefits from blunting the surgical stress response are likely to be greatest in high-risk patients such as those having major non-cardiac surgery. We will study three interventions potentially modulating perioperative inflammation, corticosteroids, tight glucose control and light anesthesia and their effects on major morbidity and mortality resulting from major non-cardiac surgery.~Steroids are the most powerful routinely available anti-inflammatory drugs. They decrease perioperative concentrations of inflammatory markers and improve outcomes after cardiac and abdominal surgery.~Poorly controlled blood glucose worsens the inflammatory response to surgery. Hyperglycemia impairs wound healing, increases infection risk, increases overall hospital mortality, increases the risk of perioperative renal failure, and augments transfusion requirements. Treatment of hyperglycemia has been shown to improve outcomes and decrease mortality in cardiac patients. Also in critically ill patients, it decreased inflammatory markers, overall hospital mortality by 34%, blood stream infections by 46%, and acute renal failure by 41%.~Cumulative deep hypnotic time is associated with increased one-year all-cause mortality, possibly through aggravation of the inflammatory response to surgery. In contrast, avoidance of deep anesthesia appears to reduce postoperative CRP levels, the risk of nausea and vomiting, as well as postoperative hemodynamic, respiratory and infectious complications.~Evidence thus suggests that steroid administration, tight glucose control, and avoidance of deep anesthesia may decrease perioperative morbidity by reducing the inflammatory response to surgery. Using a three-way factorial approach, we thus propose to test the primary hypotheses that major perioperative morbidity is reduced by: 1) low-dose dexamethasone; 2) intensive perioperative glucose control; and, 3) lighter anesthesia.~Secondary hypotheses include that each intervention reduces circulating concentrations of the inflammatory marker CRP, and that there is a correlation between CRP and post-operative complications.

NCT01775670,Off-the-Shelf Splints Versus Occupational Therapy Splints for Treatment of Trapeziometacarpal Arthrosis,"Due to the principal investigator leaving the institution and slow enrollment, we have decided to close the study prior to study completion",The specific aim is to compare the effectiveness of Off-the-Shelf splints and splints provided by Occupational Therapy for treatment of trapeziometacarpal (TMC) arthrosis.,"Trapeziometacarpal (TMC) arthrosis is so common, particularly in women, that it should be considered a normal part of the aging process. Overall radiographic prevalence of TMC arthrosis has been described to be as high as 91% in patients older than eighty years of age. It increases steadily from the age of 41 years, more rapidly in women than in men. Another study, conducted in the Netherlands, showed that in a population of 55 years and older, 67% of women and 55% of men had radiographic signs of arthrosis of the hand. It also found that the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are most commonly affected (47%), followed by the TMC joint (36%). However, it has been reported that in symptomatic arthrosis, TMC arthrosis contributes more to pain and disability than arthrosis of the interphalangeal joints. Psychosocial factors have been recognized as the strongest determinants of highly variable pain intensity and arm-specific disability. The pathophysiologic and psychosocial differences between patients who present to the doctor for treatment and those who do not are incompletely understood.~A hand-based thumb spica splint with the interphalangeal (IP) joint free is a specific nonoperative palliative treatment for TMC arthrosis. The goals of splint wear are improved comfort and function. The data regarding specific splint materials are limited, but suggest that shorter more flexible splints are preferred by patients and equally effective. Recently, the investigators looked into if there was a difference between thermoplast and neoprene hand-based thumb spica splints for treatment of TMC arthrosis. The neoprene splint was rated more comfortable than the thermoplast splint but otherwise there was no difference.~To the investigators' knowledge no studies have looked at the added value of occupational therapy in splint treatment for TMC arthrosis. The investigators believe that the time spent by occupational therapists (OTs) coaching patients on adaptive and palliative measures is valuable in addition to their technical skills but the investigators cannot draw any conclusions until the investigators research this in a prospective trial.~The investigators propose a two arm unblinded, randomized (1:1) controlled trial to evaluate if there is a difference between prefabricated off-the-shelf splints and splints provided by an OT with standard care coaching. The investigators want to determine if there is a difference in arm-specific disability, average pain, and satisfaction at an average of 2 months between splints provided by an OT and prefabricated off-the-shelf splints."

NCT02508324,IPA Targeted Adoptive Immunotherapy vs Adult Haplo-identical Cell Infusion During Induction of High Risk Leukemia,Slow accrual and change in direction of cord blood program,"The purpose of this study is to determine the overall safety of adoptive immunotherapy when given after chemotherapy for AML/MDS. Adoptive immunotherapy means using an infusion of cells from a donor to help fight cancer. The donor cells will be either from the umbilical cord blood (UCB) of a newborn baby or they will be cells collected from a relative (haplo-identical cells).~The 2 cohorts that were discussed - adoptive immunotherapy with either UCB or haplo-identical stem cells - will be analyzed separately.~Preliminary data from other centers has suggested that adoptive immunotherapy with cells from a relative is an effective approach that may improve remission rates and survival in AML and MDS, because they exert anti-cancer effects of their own (so called graft vs leukemia effects) and possibly because they hasten recovery of cell counts from chemotherapy. The Investigators are interested in confirming these data, but also in testing umbilical cord blood cells for the same purpose. Preliminary data indicate that umbilical cord blood cells may have more powerful graft vs leukemia effects and cause fewer side-effects.","This is a phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety of adoptive immunotherapy with Non-Inherited Maternal Antigen (NIMA) compatible, Inherited Paternal Antigen (IPA) targeted CBU or with haplo-identical stem cells after conventional induction therapy for very high risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).~The study has 2 cohorts - patients in cohort 1 will receive CBU cells as adoptive immunotherapy. Patients in cohort 2 will receive haplo-identical cells. Both cohorts will be evaluated separately and no formal statistical comparison between cohorts will be performed.~There will be approximately 20 patients in each cohort, and a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of patients experiencing grade III-IV GVHD complications or unexplained prolonged myelosuppression complications in each cohort can be constructed to be within +/- 13.1% of the observed complication proportions. This calculation assumes an expected prevalence of each of these complication proportions of no greater than 10%.~After 10 patients are enrolled in each group, the incidence of the above-defined life-threatening complications will be assessed. If more than one patient out of 10 enrolled patients (i.e., greater than 10%) in a cohort experiences either of these complications, the cohort will be stopped for safety.~All potential recipients will have complete HLA typing and determination of HLA antibodies. An appropriate umbilical cord blood unit (CBU) will be identified or in the absence of an appropriate CBU, a haplo-identical donor will be identified.~Treatment will be as per the treating physician's choice..~The umbilical cord graft or haplo-graft will be administered between 24 - 72 hours after the completion of the chemotherapy regimen.~The Graft Selection Algorithm is as follows:~1. CBU Unit 5/6 Matched - 1 NIMA match with patient~2. CBU Unit 5/6 Matched - Shared IPA target(s) with patient~3. Haplo-identical relative~4. CBU Unit 4/6 Matched - 1-2 NIMA matches with patient~5. CBU Unit 4/6 Matched - Shared IPA target(s) with patient~Within 42 days of transplant, the recipient's pre-treatment evaluation includes: medical history and physical examinations, Eastern Cooperative Group Oncology Group (ECOG) score, complete blood count (CBC), HLA antibodies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody testing.~Patients will continue with the therapy specified in this protocol until one of the following occurs:~* Achievement of protocol endpoint complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) after induction and cellular therapy;~* Failure to achieve CR or CRp; or,~* Extraordinary Medical Circumstances: If, at any time the constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, remove the patient from protocol treatment. In this event.~After removal from protocol therapy, patients will continue to be followed for survival and disease status.

NCT04149990,Angiotensin-Neprilysin Inhibition in Diastolic Dysfunction After AMI,Low recruitment,This study examines the effect of Entresto on central hemodynamic parameters during exercise in patients with diastolic dysfunction following acute myocardial infarction. Half of the patients will receive Entresto and the other half will receive placebo.,"In patients with acute myocardial infraction (AMI) only 25-33% have entirely normal left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function. Studies have show that echocardiographic signs of increased LV filling pressure (diastolic dysfunction) are associated with poor outcome after AMI. The optimal management of this group of patients is currently not known. LCZ696 is a novel combination drug consisting of two antihypertensives, sacubitril and valsartan. LCZ696 have demonstrated to reduce mortality in patients with systolic heart failure. In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction a positive effect has been demonstrated on natriuretic peptides and left atrial remodelling when treated with LCZ696, further, experimental data suggest inhibition of cardiac fibrosis.~Hypothesis:~LCZ696 compared with placebo will improve central hemodynamics (reduce pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)), and increase cardiac index (CI) during exercise in patients with diastolic dysfunction following AMI.

NCT00119366,"Iodine I 131 Monoclonal Antibody BC8, Fludarabine Phosphate, Total Body Irradiation, and Donor Stem Cell Transplant Followed by Cyclosporine and Mycophenolate Mofetil in Treating Patients With Advanced Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome",Funding ended before target accrual was reached; participants are no longer being examined or receiving intervention.,"This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8 when given together with fludarabine phosphate, total-body irradiation, and donor stem cell transplant followed by cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. Also, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving fludarabine phosphate and total-body irradiation before the transplant together with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening. Giving a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody together with donor stem cell transplant, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil may be an effective treatment for advanced acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:~I. To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the transplant-related mortality (TRM) and toxicity of delivering 131I-BC8 (iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8) (anti-cluster of differentiation \[CD\]45 antibody) at a starting dose of 22 Gy to the normal organ receiving the highest dose in combination with the non-myeloablative regimen of fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) (FLU), 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), cyclosporine (CSP), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related or unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients 16 to 50 years old who have advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).~II. To estimate rates of donor chimerism resulting from this combined preparative regimen and to correlate level of donor chimerism with estimated radiation doses delivered to hematopoietic tissues via antibody.~III.

NCT01296035,Panitumumab and Gemcitabine in Relapsed Ovarian Cancer,Newer technologies available; poor accrual to study.,"This is a study to find out if the study drug, panitumumab, when given with gemcitabine works in treating ovarian cancer and to find out what side effects occur when they are given together.","Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains a leading cause of gynecologic cancer mortality in women, with more than 22,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. Due to the lack of effective screening strategies and subtle early symptoms, eighty percent of newly diagnosed patients have disease that is advanced. Despite cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant paclitaxel-based and platinum-based chemotherapy, 5-year survival rates continue to be less than 40%. For patients who become resistant to the platinum compounds (defined as progressive disease while on a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (refractory) or within 6 months of completing a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (resistant)),the outlook is particularly poor, and often heralds multi-drug resistant disease.~At the present time, the management of ovarian cancer in the platinum refractory disease state is limited to palliative intent. Patients with advanced, bulky tumors, poor performance status and nutritional compromise are unlikely to respond to therapy and may be best served by supportive care. The clinical management of refractory disease requires both patience and persistence. A patient with platinum refractory disease is begun on one of the agents with activity and an evaluation of response is made every 6-8 weeks of therapy. As long as the patient shows no signs of disease progression, the therapy can be continued unless there is unacceptable toxicity. When progressive disease is observed, another of the list of available agents can be used. It is likely that patients will receive multiple single agents during the chronic phase of their illness. Every effort should be made to balance disease response with toxicity and quality of life.~Based on this rational, this trial will be conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of panitumumab, a human antibody targeted to the EGF-R, and Gemcitabine, in treating women with recurrent platinum-refractory/resistant EOC. Our aim is to determine the safety and feasibility of gemcitabine and panitumumab therapy in this population and once completed, to proceed with an efficacy study using an expanded cohort."

NCT01985022,Changing Developmental Trajectories Through Early Treatment,Participant enrollment was hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the study was ultimately terminated.,"The major objective of this research protocol is to directly compare two parent intervention conditions of Early Social Interaction (ESI) for 9 months on developmental trajectories of infants showing early risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Participants will be randomized to receive an information, education and support group (Group) ESI intervention offered weekly, or a parent-implemented intervention (Individual) ESI intervention offered in twice-weekly, in combination with the Group ESI intervention.","Mounting evidence exists of the effectiveness of intensive early intervention for a substantial proportion of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Furthermore, age of entry into intervention may be predictive of outcome. Children with ASD in intensive interventions beginning by 3.5 years of age had significantly better outcomes than those beginning after age 5. These findings support the importance of early identification and intervention for improving outcomes. There is very limited research on children with ASD under 3 years of age primarily because the median age for diagnosis in the US is 5.5 years. With advances in earlier screening and diagnosis, there is a pressing need to develop early intervention programs that are appropriate and effective with very young children with ASD.~The Early Social Interaction (ESI) Project is an intervention program developed for toddlers at risk for ASD and their families as a model demonstration project funded by the United States Department of Education. ESI was designed to incorporate the National Research Council (NRC) recommendations within the context of a family-centered, natural-environments approach. The major components of ESI are:~1. routines-based intervention in natural environments~2. individualized curriculum~3. parent-implemented intervention~The Emory Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) will recruit parent-infant dyads at 12 months of infant's age from a pool of High-Risk for Developing ASD younger siblings and from a pool of low risk infants being studied at the Emory ACE. Parents are involved in the intervention itself while the study outcome measures are focused on the infants that are receiving the different interventions (demographic and outcome data are not collected on the parents of the infants). Infant participants will be randomized to receive an ESI intervention delivered in a group setting, or an individual ESI intervention combined with the group ESI.

NCT01600742,Vorinostat and Concurrent Whole Brain Radiotherapy for Brain Metastasis,Sponsor stops to provide the study drug.,Vorinostat is a potent and well tolerated HDAC inhibitor. It has been reported to enhance radiosensitivity of cancer cells. We hypothesize that the addition of vorinostat to WBRT may increase therapeutic efficacy for patients with brain metastases.,"Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with brain metastases. Although WBRT yields high radiologic response rate (27\~56%) and is effective in palliation of neurologic symptoms, the response duration is limited and neurologic progression remains the main cause of death in a significant number of patients.~Vorinostat is reasonably well tolerated and there is also compelling evidence that vorinostat may serve as a radiosensitizer. Preclinical studies of HDAC inhibition have also shown efficacy in neuron protection. These data suggest that the addition of vorinostat to the standard therapy of WBRT may potentially increase their therapeutic efficacy without increasing neurotoxicity, and support the rationale of this phase II trial of vorinostat with WBRT in patients with brain metastases."

Favorable early experience with magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) demonstrates that metabolic imaging can identify active tumor beyond standard MRI as well as high risk regions at risk for local failure. There is also clinical evidence that limited field dose escalation with either simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is feasible and safe. Coupling these findings provide the rationale for this proposed Phase II trial designed to define efficacy and toxicity of the novel treatment approach of whole brain volumetric 3D MRSI guided dose-escalated radiation therapy (RT) in newly diagnosed GBM patients.","This phase II study will investigate efficacy and safety of volumetric 3D MRSI-directed treatment for newly diagnosed GBM patients. This study will enroll 48 patients in order to obtain at least 40 patients receiving RT and temozolomide. Depending on the size and number of HTVs, a patient will receive either simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) with IMRT (Group 1) or SRS boost followed by IMRT 1 week later (Group 2). Duration of enrollment will be 2 years and minimum follow-up will be 2 years.~The duration of treatment and follow-up will occur as follows:~* Six weeks of RT with concurrent Temozolomide treatment;~* 3D MRSI at week 3 and at the end of RT;~* 28 day break;~* Adjuvant treatment with Temozolomide administered daily on days 1-5 of each cycle, for up to 12 cycles (one cycle = 28 days) which will include standard gadolinium enhanced MRI and 3D MRSI prior to cycle 1, 5, 9, and post cycle 12 of adjuvant Temozolomide;~* Active follow-up at least every three months for one year after the end of adjuvant Temozolomide treatment;~* After one year follow-up for survival will occur every three months for one year."

NCT04313179,Music Therapy for Pain Management for Minor Procedures in Neonates.,COVID-19 pandemic prevented further enrollment. Interim analysis showed adequate power achieved.,The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of music therapy as adjuvant therapy for pain management in newborns undergoing minor painful procedures. It is a prospective study and we plan to enroll 200 healthy full term newborns undergoing minor procedures (heel pricks). They will be randomly assigned to either control or music group. Those in music group will receive recorded Mozart lullaby music. Pain will be assessed using NIPS (Neonatal Infant Pain Scale) scoring tool. The potential benefit of the study would be identifying music a safe and efficient adjuvant therapy for pain management in newborns.,"This randomized, controlled, double blinded, clinical trial will include full term neonates undergoing painful minor procedures (heel pricks) in the Nursery unit of Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center.~One of the investigators involved in the study will obtain consent from the legal guardian and enroll the participants. All infants, regardless of the group that they are assigned, will receive similar standard non-pharmacologic method of pain relief which is 0.5 ml of 24% Sucrose, 2 minutes before undergoing heel prick. Pacifiers will be avoided to avoid potential confounding.~Subjects will be randomized into two different groups. Group A, music intervention group and group B, control group. In the music intervention group, a recorded instrumental lullaby music track called Deep Sleep from Bedtime Mozart: Classical Lullabies for Babies, will be played for the neonates through smart phone speakers (maximum sound up to 60 A dB), starting 20 minutes before the heel prick, continuing through the procedure and for 5 minutes after the procedure. This music track has been selected based on previous research studies that showed effectiveness in neonatal pain management.~An investigator involved in the study will place the baby in a bassinet in a quite, dim lighted room. He/She will play the music for those babies in the music group and will NOT assess the NIPS. Another investigator wearing active noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones (for blinding) will enter the room at 5 minutes prior to the procedure and assess the NIPS at appropriate intervals: 5 minutes prior and at 1-minute interval during and after the procedure for 5 minutes. NIPS will be compared using appropriate statistical methods."

NCT02072057,Study of Ruxolitinib in the Treatment of Cachexia in Patients With Tumor-Associated Chronic Wasting Diseases.,Poor recruiting,"The aim of this study is to investigate the effects and safety of Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor for the treatment of tumor-associated cachexia in chronic wasting diseases.","Cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by tissue wasting, loss of body weight, particularly of lean body (muscle) mass (LBM) and to a lesser extent adipose tissue, metabolic alterations, fatigue, reduced performance status, and very often accompanied by anorexia leading to a reduced food intake. Cachexia accompanies the end stage of many chronic diseases and especially cancer and therefore is also termed cancer-related anorexia/cachexia syndrome (CACS). Clinically, cachexia is defined as an unintentional 5% resp. 10% loss of body weight over a 6-month resp. 12-month period that is directly associated with an underlying disease. The progressive loss of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle despite adequate feeding results in weakness, reduced ambulation, diminished quality of life, poor response to therapy, and often death due to respiratory failure or infection. At the time of cancer diagnosis, 80% of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers and 60% of patients with lung cancer have already had substantial weight loss. Currently, there are no approved effective treatments for the treatment of cachexia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for muscle wasting is necessary to develop targeted therapies that play a central role in signal transduction initiated by cytokines (e.g., interleukin and interferon signaling), growth factors, and hormones for these most vulnerable patients. Key features of CACS are increased resting energy expenditure (REE), increased levels of circulating factors produced by the host immune system in response to the tumor, such as proinflammatory cytokines, or by the tumor itself, such as proteolysis-inducing factor. Inflammation is a unifying mechanism for the entire cluster of sickness behaviours (asthenia, increased slow-wave sleep, mood alteration, lethargy, depression, anorexia, fever, anhedonia, cognitive impairment, hyperalgesia and decreased social interaction), including lipolysis and muscle proteolysis. Inflammation is generated in the brain, by the tumor, by tissues in the locale of the tumor and by a diversity of host cells including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, cells of the immune system, and liver. The specific identity of the inflammation mediators participating in cancer cachexia is emerging. Both host and tumor-derived factors have been shown experimentally to contribute to muscle wasting. There is evidence that a chronic, low-grade, tumor-induced activation of the host immune system, which shares numerous characteristics with the acute-phase response found after major traumatic events, septic shock or chronic inflammatory diseases with an excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines, is involved in CACS. Proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-a) play a central role in the pathophysiology of CACS, although the mechanisms by which they might induce muscle wasting are unknown. A goal of anorexia-cachexia therapy is to interfere with these responses to inflammation and so to restore positive energy balance and to promote the gain of skeletal muscle mass. Understanding the specific management of the initiating inflammatory pathways is crucial to that end. Recently a study reported that a Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) protein (STAT3) activation is a common feature of muscle wasting, activated in muscle by IL-6 in vivo and in vitro, by different types of cancer, and by sterile sepsis. Moreover, STAT3 activation is necessary and sufficient for causing muscle wasting. Conversely, the same authors showed that inhibiting STAT3 pharmacologically with Janus kinase (JAK) or STAT3 inhibitors or genetically reduced muscle atrophy downstream of IL-6 or cancer. Epidemiological studies suggest that as many as 25% of all cancers may be due to chronic inflammation. The connection between inflammation and cancer consists of an extrinsic pathway, driven by inflammatory conditions that increase cancer risk, and an intrinsic pathway, driven by oncogenic alterations that result in creation of an inflammatory microenvironment that resolves in neoplasias. Immune cells play key roles in connecting inflammation and cancer by producing various growth or angiogenic factors, proteinases, chemokines, and cytokines that create a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. This milieu stimulates cell migration, proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and facilitates the subversion of adaptive immunity, thus favoring cancer progression.~These theoretical considerations as well as pharmacological results and data from animal models indicated that the JAK/STAT pathway is a primary mediator of muscle wasting in cancer cachexia and other conditions of high IL-6 family signaling. Thus JAK/STAT pathway could represent a novel therapeutic target for the preservation of skeletal muscle in cachexia. On the basis of this rationale, we want to carry out an open label phase II study with the aim of testing the efficacy and safety of a treatment based on a pharmacologic inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 pathway with Ruxolitinib in patients with CACS. Ruxolitinib represents a novel orally bioavailable, potent, and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 developed primarily for the treatment of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs). A key feature of MPNs is the dysregulation of JAK/STAT signaling."

NCT02442102,PReventing the EffectS of Intubation on DEglutition,slow recruitment,"An early intervention for swallowing disorders (i.e., dysphagia) during endotracheal intubation may improve patient outcomes. The investigators propose treatment sessions targeting sensorimotor integration, strength, and range of motion during oral endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation to reduce or prevent dysphagia and aspiration (food or liquids entering the airway), establish a solid foundation in understanding reasons for swallowing impairment after extubation from mechanical ventilation and learn new methods to reduce or prevent these problems.","The overall goals of this study are to evaluate patients with acute respiratory failure from the time they are orally intubated in the ICU to: 1) investigate tongue weakness and other pathophysiological aspects of dysphagia, and 2) evaluate, in a Phase II clinical trial, a novel, multimodal, sensorimotor intervention conducted during intubation to reduce or prevent dysphagia after extubation. Patients who are expected to be intubated with mechanical ventilation for \>96 hours will be consecutively enrolled shortly after intubation. Laryngeal function, tongue strength, swallowing pathophysiology, and breathing-swallowing coordination will be evaluated with valid and reliable standardized measures. While orally intubated, patients in the treatment group will receive a novel, early, sensorimotor intervention for 60-minutes daily, 5 times per week, targeting improved swallowing physiology and kinematics to reduce aspiration and dysphagia. These daily sessions will continue until the completion of a modified barium swallow study conducted within approximately 2 days after extubation, and thereafter standard clinical care will resume. Patients in the control group will receive standard clinical care during intubation and throughout their hospital stay. All patients will be followed to hospital discharge to determine the pathophysiological and clinical impact of the proposed intervention. Knowledge from this study will provide important data for this novel intervention and provide a critical foundation for understanding the physiological mechanisms of dysphagia and aspiration after intubation in patients with acute respiratory failure. With success, this investigation will help shift clinical practice patterns to consider early intervention with the goal of reducing the frequency and severity of swallowing impairment leading to aspiration and additional medical complications."

These benefits involve functional state of the heart and reduction damage to the organ. These events are related to intracellular phenomena that result in intracellular calcium homeostasis giving physical and functional benefits to the heart. Also disclosed is a modulation of the inflammatory response to endothelial level with resulting protective character to the coronary bed.~Patients submitted of coronary angioplasty procedures can release in varying degrees of creatine kinase, MB isoform (CK - MB), on the order of 30% of all angioplasty. Even in smaller increases than 3 times baseline, a criterion that defines myocardial infarction, clinical impact can already be found. Increase in CK-MB more than 100% of baseline can represents a problem to the patients. This elevation of CK - MB is associated with various factors such as age, characteristic of the lesion, clinical status of the patient, inferring that endovascular procedures of coronary, simple or complex, have associated myocardial damage, which depending on the intensity of the damage, results in increased morbidity and mortality.~BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:~Check for reduction in the percentage of patients that release CK -MB at levels above the 100% baseline in patients anesthetized with sevoflurane compared to the control group.

NCT00791089,Effects of Fish Oil on Post Ablation Arrhythmias,unable to secure funding and long term follow up,To determine if peri-operative treatment with omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a decrease in the incidence of early recurrences of atrial arrhythmias (within 30 days) and an improvement in probability of long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm after radiofrequency catheter ablation for Atrial Fibrillation.,"AF is the most prevalent arrhythmia, affecting \>2 million Americans. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy often is ineffective to eliminate recurrent episodes of AF. In recent years radiofrequency catheter ablation has emerged as a highly effective treatment strategy in patients with paroxysmal and chronic AF.6, 7 However, AF may recur within days to weeks after a successful ablation procedure in up to 50% of the patients, probably because of an inflammatory response to thermal injury caused by radiofrequency energy application. These early recurrences of AF after ablation do not necessarily predict long-term clinical outcome and 30-50% of patients who develop early recurrences ultimately remain in sinus rhythm without the need for additional ablation.8 However, early recurrences of AF may be associated with significant morbidity due to troubling symptoms of rapid ventricular rates, multiple hospital visits and cardioversions, need for antiarrhythmic drug therapy and prolongation in duration of anticoagulant therapy. It is also possible that if early recurrences of AF after ablation can be avoided, the probability of remaining in sinus rhythm during long-term follow-up may be higher, as maintenance of sinus rhythm early-on may facilitate reverse left atrial remodeling. A similar phenomenon may occur in post-operative AF, that develops in \~30% of patients who undergo cardiac surgery. Post-operative AF is often transient and usually resolves within 3 months after the surgery. Perioperative treatment with omega-3 fatty acids has been reported to decrease the incidence of postoperative AF after coronary artery by-pass surgery.4 Because the pathogenetic factors that play a role in postoperative AF and early recurrences of AF after radiofrequency catheter ablation may be similar, it is plausible that treatment with omega-3 fatty acids before and after ablation will be associated with a reduction in the incidence of early recurrences of AF."

Participants will be enrolled as outpatients within 72 hrs of onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The study will evaluate the safety of the intervention through 28 days of follow-up as compared to the control arm as assessed by cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), cumulative incidence of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs), and/or discontinuation or temporary suspension of the investigational medication (for any reason). Additionally, the study will aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy of melatonin as compared to placebo as assessed by hospitalization, COVID-19 related symptoms and mortality. The ultimate goal is to determine in an adequately powered study if the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions of Melatonin can reduce the severity and prevent progression of COVID-19 when started in mild disease."
NCT00622947,The Antidepressant Effect of Right Temporal Low Frequency rTMS Compared to Sham,Too few patients included,The aim of the present study is to compare the antidepressant effect of low frequency rTMS applied over the right temporal cortex with sham stimulation.,"TMS complies focal stimulation of the brain through a time varying magnetic field. Clinical controlled trials indicate that rTMS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may have an antidepressant effect and no serious side effects. Several clinical controlled studies investigating the antidepressant effect of low as well as high frequency rTMS of the right and left prefrontal cortex have been carried out with varying results.Research on the issue suffer from small and selected study populations.There is a need for additional clinical controlled studies on larger samples and methodological investigations to clarify what is the optimal stimulus design for the treatment of depressed patients.~Recent research indicates that Depression is associated with an increased metabolic activity of subcortical areas especially the right hippocampus of the brain.~Remission of depression symptoms is associated with normalisation of the described subcortical hyperactivity.~Low frequency rTMS has shown to be associated with sustained reduction in neuronal activity.~There may be an association between the activity decreasing effect of low frequency rTMS and reduction in psychiatric symptoms.~The investigators want to test the hypothesis that low frequency rTMS of the right temporal subcortical areas (Hippocampus and and the parahippocampal part of CNS) may perform an antidepressant effect by normalizing the described hyperactivity of the subcortical areas in depressed patients.~In addition the investigators want to test whether blood concentration of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor( BDNF), the BDNF-genotype and saliva cortisol may be of predictive value in depressed patients."
NCT01139125,An Open Trial of Cysteamine Treatment in Schizophrenia,The study was stopped after 4 years of recruitment difficulties.,The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability of the medication cysteamine bitartrate on schizophrenia patients and to evaluate the effect of the medication on the symptoms of schizophrenia.,"Despite the availability of numerous antipsychotics, the treatment of schizophrenia is very unsatisfactory. Many patients have persistent positive psychotic symptoms or negative symptoms despite treatment, and any improvement in cognitive function is small. New approaches to the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia that are not based primarily on dopaminergic blockade are needed.~The rationale for a trial of cysteamine comes from the evidence that cysteamine increases brain concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.~We will conduct an open-label study of tolerability and efficacy of cysteamine as an adjunct to second-generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia and schizoaffective subjects with partially responsive symptoms.~Our objectives are to determine the safety and tolerability of cysteamine administered as an adjunct to second-generation antipsychotic drugs in adult outpatients with partially-responsive schizophrenia. Additionally, we are evaluating the effect of cysteamine on the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as measured by changes in the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and on cognitive impairment as measured by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS)."
NCT00006224,Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Cancer of the Cervix,,RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.~PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine in treating patients who have persistent or recurrent cancer of the cervix.,OBJECTIVES:~* Determine the antitumor activity of gemcitabine in patients with persistent or recurrent nonsquamous cell carcinoma of the cervix who failed higher priority treatment protocols.~* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.~OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.~Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes weekly for 3 weeks.

NCT05817344,New Beginnings Following Trauma,Participant recruitment,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased rates of prescription opioid misuse, high-risk opioid use, illicit use of substances, and overdose (Meshberg-Cohen et al., 2021) Some research has demonstrated that among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), 92% report exposure to a traumatic event (Mills et al., 2005). Approximately 41% of those with OUD have a lifetime history of PTSD and 33.2% of individuals with OUD meet current diagnostic criteria for PTSD, indicating very high rates of PTSD among people with co-occurring OUD (Mills et al., 2006, 2007). PTSD also prospectively increases risk for OUD after exposure to opioids (Hassan et al., 2017).~Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are evidence-based pharmacological interventions for OUD (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) to manage pain and withdrawal (Leshner \& Mancher, 2019). Though effective, dropout from MOUD programs is high (Mokri et al., 2016; O'Connor et al., 2020). It is also common in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment settings not to treat PTSD (Norman \& Hien, 2020), though concurrent PTSD and MOUD treatment is associated with higher continuation in MOUD programs compared to no PTSD treatment (Meshberg-Cohen et al., 2019; Schacht et al., 2017). Despite this, there is little data regarding efficacy or effectiveness of specific trauma-focused PTSD treatments among patients in MOUD programs.~Combined with effective cognitive-behavioral techniques for substance use disorder (SUD), evaluation of brief, trauma-focused interventions for PTSD has substantial potential to improve care for individuals with PTSD receiving MOUD. The present study will begin to address this need by evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of Written Exposure Therapy (WET) for PTSD integrated with harm reduction skills for managing SUD symptoms among a sample of patients receiving MOUD \[Written Exposure Therapy-Integrated (WET-I)\]. WET is a five-session treatment for PTSD requiring limited therapist training and minimal patient burden (Sloan \& Marx, 2019). WET has shown comparable outcomes to gold-standard interventions for PTSD, with improved retention rates (Sloan et al., 2018). WET has marked potential within this population, especially given that many clinicians in SUD programs do not have specialized training in PTSD treatments (Killeen et al., 2015).~Using a multiple baseline single case experimental design (SCED), 6 participants with current PTSD and current or past OUD will be recruited from MOUD treatment programs to engage in 5 weekly sessions of WET-I. Participants will complete an intake assessment to establish PTSD and OUD diagnoses and will be randomized to a 3- or 5-week baseline assessment period. Weekly assessments of symptoms (i.e., PTSD, anxiety, depression), substance craving and use, quality of life, and compliance with MOUD treatment will be completed during the baseline, treatment, and one-month follow-up phase. During the treatment phase, participants will also complete weekly measures of therapeutic alliance and will provide feedback on treatment credibility and treatment satisfaction.~Aim 1: To examine feasibility and acceptability of WET-I among participants in MOUD treatment with co-occurring PTSD/OUD. Feasibility of WET-I will be demonstrated via treatment retention and completion. Acceptability of engaging in WET-I in tandem with MOUD treatment will be demonstrated via high patient credibility ratings of WET-I and high treatment satisfaction ratings.~Aim 2: To determine if WET-I can significantly reduce symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression in participants with comorbid PTSD and OUD and to monitor changes in drug use behaviors and craving over the treatment period. Participants will report reliable clinical improvement in symptoms (PTSD, anxiety, depression) and quality of life during the treatment phase and post-assessment without corresponding increases in substance use behavior or craving, and these improvements will be maintained at follow-up.","Individuals interested in participating in this study will complete a phone screening or online screening based on individual preference to determine if they are likely to be eligible and can be scheduled for a telehealth or in-person diagnostic intake to take place at the Stress Trauma and Recovery Research Collaborative (STARRC) within the UK Clinic for Emotional Health. All participants will be provided with details regarding the screening questions and will be required to provide verbal consent over the phone or review a cover letter consent form (similar to the phone screening) online before proceeding with the screening. Once scheduled for an intake, participants will be sent a link to complete the intake questionnaires online prior to the start of the intake appointment. A cover letter consent form is attached for these questionnaires, as they will be administered before the in-person intake session. During the intake session, the participant will first be given a written and verbal description of the study and informed consent. The consent form will be presented to the participant on a tablet through REDCap, or via HIPAA-Compliant Zoom if telehealth, in which they will be asked to provide a digital signature. If consent is provided, they will be provided a copy. The PI or designated staff will discuss the informed consent form with the participant volunteer. The consent process will take place in a quiet and private room in our office or via HIPAA-Compliant Zoom. Participants may take as much time as needed to make a decision about their trial participation and may take the document home if desired. The person obtaining consent will thoroughly explain each element of the document and outline the risks and benefits, alternative treatment(s), and requirements of the study. Participants will be informed that they can withdraw from the research at any time.~Procedures and consent forms will comply with the requirements of the UK-IRB and ORI's Best Practices for Remote Informed Consent. The experimenter will then complete a consent post-test with participants. If a participant screens out of the study due to a consent capacity issue, any data from that participant that may have been previously collected during the phone screening and/or online surveys will not be used for research purposes and will be destroyed. Participants will also agree to the study's intoxication policy before signing the consent form. Participant privacy will be maintained and questions regarding participation will be answered. No coercion or undue influence will be used in the consent process. No research-related procedures will be performed prior to obtaining informed consent. All signatures and dates will be obtained. A copy of the signed consent will be given to the participant. Signed electronic consents will be maintained and stored through REDCap and will be separated from participant data.~After completing and signing the consent form at the intake appointment, eligible participants will be required to sign a release of information from the research team granting the research team permission to contact their methadone or buprenorphine program to coordinate care for the participant. Any additional release of information required from individual methadone or buprenorphine treatment facilities will be obtained for each participant as needed.~Initial Screening~Upon referral to the study, participants will complete a brief phone or internet screening based on participant preference to determine eligibility for an intake appointment. Screening forms for individuals who are deemed ineligible for the study for reasons other than consent capacity issues will be retained for study records and future research purposes that may be developed in the lab or by lab collaborators for which data may be useful.~First Baseline and Intake~Likely eligible participants, determined by the initial screen, will be asked to complete a battery of self-report questionnaires, which will assess for presence of DSM-5 psychological disorders, symptoms of anxiety/depression, level of functioning (e.g., quality of life), measures of PTSD, substance use, and substance craving (also to be completed online via REDCap). This survey platform is designed specifically for collection of research data, and therefore meets the privacy standards imposed on health care records by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Referral information for resources to manage symptom difficulty will also be provided in the cover letter for these questionnaires. Likely eligible participants will be invited to attend the intake in-person or via telehealth in the PI's research lab at the Clinic for Emotional Health. A study assessor (i.e., doctoral students in clinical psychology/post-doctoral scholar/PI/Co-Is) will review study procedures with potential participants and ask them to provide their informed consent. After informed consent is provided, an interview-based diagnostic assessment will be administered in order to confirm clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria and urine and breathalyzer substance use screenings will be completed (for in-person participants only). This assessment visit will be video and/or audio-recorded. Recording via audio and/or video will be required for participation. Those who do not meet criteria for PTSD and/or other eligibility criteria will be told at the end of the assessment that they will not be able to continue in the study and will be provided referrals in-person or over email or postal mail for other treatment options depending on participant preference. Participants who do not endorse required eligibility criteria or who do endorse ineligibility criteria during the intake will not be permitted to continue in the study.~Baseline Period~Eligible participants will then be randomized to either a three- or five-week baseline where they will complete weekly measures of PTSD symptoms, symptoms of anxiety/depression, quality of life, substance use, and substance craving, and questions to determine whether they are in compliance with requirements of their MOUD program.~Treatment Period~The same questionnaire battery and substance use screenings will be repeated each week during therapy sessions, along with additional post-session ratings about treatment credibility and therapeutic alliance as well as interviews of substance use and urine and breathalyzer substance use screenings (for in-person participants). Urine and breathalyzer tests are standard operating procedure for studies assessing substance use behaviors in addition to self-reports of substance use.~Offering biological data to support participant self-reports is consistent with common research practices and will bolster scientific rigor of data reported in published manuscripts. If participants are completing treatment remotely, they will not complete substance use urine/breathalyzer screenings, but will still complete interviews of substance use via HIPAA-Compliant Zoom. Participants will then begin their first of five WET-I sessions. In WET, patients are provided with psychoeducation about trauma and PTSD in their first session and given explicit instruction on writing about the details of their most distressing trauma throughout treatment for 30 minutes each session followed by 10 minutes of structured discussion regarding the writing process. At the end of this discussion, therapists will introduce harm reduction strategies that will include 20 minutes of discussion in which therapists and participants will work together to establish and track the participant's goals for maintaining recovery over the next 5 weeks, discuss how engagement in WET-I can impact or cause barriers to these goals as well as ways in which the therapist can assist them in reducing barriers and achieving their goals, and discuss skills for safe substance use as needed (e.g., minimizing mixing substances, testing substances for fentanyl, using substances with people equipped to administer naloxone). The first session will be approximately 80 minutes while the remaining four will be approximately 60 minutes in length. Following completion of the treatment, participants will be asked to provide satisfaction ratings and written qualitative feedback on their experience with the treatment they received at the end of their last treatment session.~In order to bolster participation in weekly assessments, participants will be compensated up to $50 for each of the weekly baseline questionnaire batteries/drug screenings. If all assessments are not completed, they will receive funds for the amount of baseline assessments that they did complete. Participants will also receive up to an additional $50 for completion of each of the weekly questionnaire batteries during the treatment portion of the study. Participants will complete the same questionnaire/screening battery for three additional weeks following their post-treatment assessment one week after ending treatment.~It is important to note that the therapeutic strategies involved in WET-I are all common, evidence-based cognitive-behavioral strategies that have been shown to be safe among substance using populations. The treatment involves written exposures as instructed by an established manual (Written Exposure Therapy for PTSD) and brief processing of the exposure with the therapist. Treatment sessions will be audio- and/or video-recorded; this will allow study staff to rate sessions for fidelity to the protocol and will be used for clinical supervision. Recording via audio and/or video will be required for participation.~All self-report questionnaires will be completed online via REDCap. Questionnaires will be completed on-site using a study iPad or participants will be sent a link via email to complete the survey batteries during their own time. Finally, although investigators anticipate that most patients will prefer to complete these measures electronically, investigators can provide paper and pencil versions of the questionnaires if requested.~Data collection will be accomplished via screening questions, diagnostic interview, and self-report questionnaires attached below.~Through these measures investigators will collect data regarding participants' experiences with psychological symptoms, life functioning, and treatment satisfaction. Participants completing the study via telehealth will be sent REDCap links that to access the secure questionnaires that are specific to them.~The measures will be administered according to the following schedule:~Baseline, Intake, and Follow-Up Assessments:~Participants completing the intake session remotely or in-person will complete all of the same measures/assessments, with the exception of urine and breathalyzer screenings, which will only be completed by in-person participants.~Demographics - Intake and First Baseline Assessment, DIAMOND self-report screener - First Baseline Assessment, DIAMOND interview - Intake, Treatment Services Tracking Form - Intake, Last Follow-up Assessment, CSSRS/SAFE-T - Intake, AUDIT - First Baseline Assessment, DUDIT - First Baseline Assessment, Q-LES-Q - Weekly, TLFB - Weekly, Substance Craving - Weekly, PCL-5 - Weekly, ODSIS - Weekly, OASIS - Weekly, MOUD Compliance - Weekly, Urine and Breathalyzer Screenings - Weekly for in-person clients only~Pre-Session and Post-Treatment Assessment (Weekly):~Q-LES-Q - Weekly, PCL-5 - Weekly, TLFB - Weekly, Substance Craving - Weekly, ODSIS - Weekly, OASIS - Weekly, MOUD Compliance - Weekly, Treatment Services Tracking Form - First Therapy Session, Last Therapy Session, Urine and Breathalyzer Screenings - Weekly for in-person clients only, AUDIT - Post-Treatment Assessment, DUDIT - Post-Treatment Assessment~Post-Session (Weekly):~HAQ - Patient and Therapist - Weekly, CEQ (post-1st treatment session only), Patient Satisfaction Form (final treatment session only)~Investigators plan to utilize a randomized multiple baseline design across participants (Barlow et al., 2009; Kazdin, 2011). This is a form of single-case experimental design that provides a time and cost-effective method of evaluating initial efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention while controlling for the passage of time and repeated assessment in small numbers of patients. Patients will be randomized to either a 3- or 5-week baseline assessment phase where weekly self-report measures will be completed prior to initiating the treatment phase of the study. Randomizing to varying baseline periods enables assessments of whether symptoms change (only or more rapidly) when the intervention is applied (i.e., each participant acts as their own control). This design allows for causal inferences and controls for many threats to internal validity. Consistent with established guidelines, quantitative data analysis will primarily be conducted via visual inspection of graphed data within- and between-subjects to evaluate the magnitude and rate of change across the baseline and treatment phases (Barlow et al., 2009; Kazdin, 2011). This will be supplemented by examining within-person mean difference effect sizes for each outcome using a d-statistic developed for single case designs and calculating the percentage of patients who evidence reliable change on symptom measures (Jacobson \& Truax, 1991; Shadish et al., 2014)."
